{"document": "Those words sung by Frank Sinatra for Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s film were ones Rotherham chairman Tony Stewart might have hoped to hear in the town's streets in July 2012 as they moved in to the New York Stadium, its name taken from that of the local area.\nAfter four years playing home games outside Rotherham, it marked a return 'home' for the Millers. But little could Stewart have realised it would result in such an upturn in fortunes on the pitch too.\n\"I took over the club six years ago and decided to build a ground that was fit for the purpose, then start working with managers to get confidence back into the town,\" said the owner of Rotherham-based ASD Lighting PLC after the Millers secured Championship promotion by beating Leyton Orient on penalties in the League One play-off final.\nAnd as chants of 'there's only one Tony Stewart' rang out inside English football's national stadium, neutrals could be forgiven for wondering who the United fans were singing about.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn a town perhaps more famous for providing the sport with World Cup final referee Howard Webb, than South Yorkshire's second Championship football team, he is the man that saved their club.\n\"If you're not a Rotherham fan, you can't understand the ups and downs we've had these past few years,\" one supporter told the Football League Show on the steps of Wembley.\nWe can at least try to.\n'These vagabond shoes, they are longing to stray'... a little strong? It is closer to the mark than you would think.\nIn 2008, Stewart bought a club in administration, preparing for a season in the Football League's basement division with a 17-point penalty.\nThat was only the half of it. A factor in the Millers' dire financial situation was the rent being charged at their stadium, Millmoor.\nThe landlords failed to strike a deal with Stewart, and with heavy heart, he laced those vagabond shoes and strayed across the M1 to nearby Sheffield.\nRotherham bedded down at the now-demolished Don Valley Stadium, with Stewart promising to fund construction of a new home in the S60 post-code range.\nA facility built for the hosting of athletics at the 1991 World University Games, Rotherham were welcome tenants for Sheffield City Council, which was struggling to cover the stadium's bills via the rent of Championship rugby league side Sheffield Eagles and the occasional athletics meeting.\nThis lighting salesman from Rotherham could not have fathomed that six years later United would be two divisions higher. Could he?\n\"My dream is probably to get to the top of the Championship. Talk to Hull, talk to Barnsley, these teams have done it before,\" Stewart told BBC Radio Sheffield two years ago.\nThree months later they made a brand new start of it.\nThe £17m New York Stadium was to be Rotherham's new home, a name coined from the fact the area previously housed the site of old steelworks firm Guest and Chrimes, a company famed for manufacturing the Big Apple's iconic red fire hydrants.\nAfter four years of League Two - including a play-off final defeat by Dagenham & Redbridge - and four managers, Stewart had made good on his pledge as the Millers returned to S60, a stone's throw from Millmoor.\nAs their final season in exile was drawing to a close, then Crawley Town manager Steve Evans was recruited as boss. His arrival, along with the stadium move, sparked Rotherham's remarkable rise.\nThe Glaswegian overhauled a squad Andy Scott had struggled to get the best out of, bringing in 12 and moving out seven players over that summer.\nAnd the 51-year-old's first full season started as Stewart had no doubt dreamed.\n\"Tony Stewart saved Rotherham United. The joyous feelings of Millers fans after back-to-back promotions is in stark contrast to the anger, confusion and despondency felt in the two-year period sparked by dropping out of the second-tier in 2005.\n\"The club was beset with problems on and off the field. They entered administration in 2006 which caused a 10-point deduction and contributed to relegation the following season.\n\"Ten more were docked the next year and 17 for Stewart's inaugural season at the helm. They needed someone of his ambition, candour, and business acumen to help them avoid more doom and gloom.\n\"We can only really guess how much money his Rotherham revolution has cost to date, but the benefit to the club and the town itself is immeasurable.\n\"Everything Stewart has said he was going to do he has done - the fact it has taken just six years is remarkable.\n\"The club and the town now have a team and a stadium to be very proud of.\"\nA 3-0 win over Burton in the new, New York Stadium was witnessed by 11,441 people - a far cry from the 4,484 that attended the curtain-raiser at Don Valley four years earlier.\nIn April, victory over Aldershot Town, ironically under the tutelage of his predecessor, secured Evans' seventh promotion as a manager.\n\"I walked out on Crawley 12 months ago to come to a club that I believe could be a Championship club,\" Evans proclaimed after finishing, not quite top of the heap, as League Two runners-up.\n\"We've got a lot of hard work to do to just be a League One club, but we'll get there very quickly under a fantastic chairman and supporters that have been incredible all season.\"\nMore evolution than revolution came in Evans' second close-season as he tweaked his squad for their first third-tier campaign since 2006-07.\nAnd as Stewart had hoped, people did want to 'be a part of it' in New York.\nHis town's enthusiasm for football did not wane. An average home gate of 8,580 saw United spend the final six months of the campaign in the play-off places, ultimately securing promotion by overcoming Preston North End and then Leyton Orient.\n\"The fans have been absolutely magnificent. I know how much it hurt them against Dagenham four years ago,\" Evans told BBC Radio Sheffield.\n\"How could you ever forget what we've achieved in these last two years? If you offered me a lottery win or this, it would be this.\nRotherham United's last stint in the second tier of English football came on the back of successive promotions in 2000 and 2001.\n\"I've been working for a great chairman but they're not always good days. There are days where there's a debate, days that aren't easy ones, but that's why Tony Stewart is as successful as he is.\n\"He's a man who has everything, so for him to tell me I've given him something money couldn't buy, I'm extremely proud.\"\nHis chairman is not done yet.\n\"For me, taking over was a challenge and it's a challenge I've enjoyed,\" said Stewart.\n\"I always say, whatever league you're in, you're in it to win it, to be at the pinnacle of that league.\n\"There's only one step higher than the Championship - the adventure goes on.\"\nAnd £30m, six years, four managers and two promotions down the road, Stewart still wants to be top of the list, head of the heap, king of the hill.\nRight there in old New York.\nInterviews by BBC Radio Sheffield's Andy Giddings and Rob Staton, and the Football League Show's Mark Clemmit.", "summary": "'Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today, I want to be a part of it, New York, New York.'", "id": "27587374"}

It alleged he deliberately changed course to perform a risky night-time sail-past salute to people on the tiny island of Giglio.\nHe told his trial he \"wanted to kill three birds with one stone\": to please the passengers, salute a retired captain on Giglio and do a favour to the vessel's head waiter, who was from the island. He has rejected rumours that he had wanted to impress his lover, Domnica Cemortan, with him at the helm.\nAs details of the unplanned change of course emerged, ship owner Costa Cruises distanced itself from the captain who, it said, had made \"serious errors of judgement\" and carried out a manoeuvre \"unauthorised, unapproved and unknown to Costa\".\nThe captain told the court that he had been been sacrificed to safeguard \"economic interests\", arguing that the court should be considering an entire organisation rather than one man.\nIn a TV interview given hours after the ship ran aground, Mr Schettino's shock and disbelief was clear as he told reporters the rocks had not been shown on his charts.\n\"We were about 300 metres from the rocks, more or less, we shouldn't have hit anything.\"\nWidely vilified in Italy for leaving his ship while passengers were still on board, Capt Schettino's reputation was further damaged when transcripts suggested he had not told the coastguard initially of the gravity of the damage to the ship.\n\"Listen Schettino, perhaps you have saved yourself from the sea, but I will make you look very bad.

I could see that everybody was happy.\"\nMs Telander is one of about 70 assistant nurses who had their days shortened for the experiment, the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers, from start-ups to nursing homes.\nDesigned to measure well-being in a sector that's struggling to recruit enough staff to care for the country's ageing population, extra nurses were brought in to cover the lost hours.\nThe project's independent researchers were also paid to study employees at a similar care home who continued to work regular days.\nTheir final report is due out next month, but data released so far strongly backs Ms Telander's arguments.\nDuring the first 18 months of the trial the nurses working shorter hours logged less sick leave, reported better perceived health and boosted their productivity by organising 85% more activities for their patients, from nature walks to sing-a-longs.\nHowever, the project also faced tough criticism from those concerned that the costs outweighed the benefits.\nCentre-right opponents filed a motion calling on Gothenburg City Council to wrap it up prematurely last May, arguing it was unfair to continue investing taxpayers' money in a pilot that was not economically sustainable.\nSaved from the axe at the eleventh hour, the trial managed to stay within budget, but still cost the city about 12 million kronor (Â£1.1m; $1.3m).\n\"Could we do this for the entire municipality? The answer is no, it will be too expensive,\" says Daniel Bernmar, the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg's elderly care.\nBut he argues the experiment still proved \"successful from many points of view\" by creating extra jobs for 17 nurses in the city, reducing sick pay costs and fuelling global debates about work culture.\n\"It's put the shortening of the work day on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe, which is fascinating,\" he says.\n\"In the past 10, 15 years there's been a lot of pressure on people working longer hours and this is sort of the contrary of that.\"\nYet while work-life balance is already championed across the political spectrum in Sweden, the chances of the Nordic country trimming back its standard 40-hour week remain slim.\nOn a national level, the Left Party is the only parliamentary party in favour of shortening basic working hours, backed by just 6% of voters in Sweden's last general election.\nNevertheless, a cluster of other Swedish municipalities are following in Gothenburg's footsteps, with locally funded trials targeting other groups of employees with high levels of illness and burnout, including social workers and hospital nurses.\nCleaners at Skelleftea Hospital will begin an 18-month project next month.\nThere's also been an increase in pilots in the private sector, with advertising, consulting, telecoms and technology firms among those testing the concept.\nYet while some have also reported that staff appear calmer or are less likely to phone in sick, others have swiftly abandoned the idea.\n\"I really don't think that the six-hour day fits with an entrepreneurial world, or the start-up world,\" argues Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Gothenburg-based bio-ink company.\nHe is candid enough to admit he tested the method on his production staff after \"reading about the trend on Facebook\" and musing on whether it could be an innovative draw for future talent.\nBut the firm's experiment was ditched in less than a month, after bad feedback from employees.\n\"I thought it would be really fun, but it felt kind of stressful,\" says Gabriel Peres, as he slots a Petri dish inside one of the 3D printers he's built for the company.\n\"It's a process and it takes time and when you don't have all that [much] time it kind of feels like skipping homework at school, things are always building up.\"\nOn the other side of the country, his concerns are shared by Dr Aram Seddigh, who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University's Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation's shifting work patterns.\n\"I think the six-hour work day would be most effective in organisations - such as hospitals - where you work for six hours and then you just leave [the workplace] and go home.\n\"It might be less effective for organisations where the borders between work and private life are not so clear,\" he suggests.\n\"This kind of solution might even increase stress levels given that employees might try to fit all the work that they have been doing in eight hours into six - or if they're office workers they might take the work home.\"\nBack in Gothenburg, Bengt Lorentzon, the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project, argues that the concept of six-hour days also jars with the strong culture of flexible working promoted by many Swedish businesses.\n\"A lot of offices are already working almost like consultancies. There's no need for managers to have all their workers in the office at the same time, they just want to get the results and people have to deliver,\" he says.\n\"Compare that to the assistant nurses - they can't just leave work to go to the dentist or to the doctors or the hairdressers.\"\n\"So I don't think people should start with the question of whether or not to have reduced hours.\n\"First, it should be: what can we do to make the working environment better?

The societal need is there.\n\"A full-blown undergraduate degree - I'd be surprised if that didn't happen within five years.\n\"Will it be fully online? Or will it have some residential components? That remains to be seen.\"\nProf Koller said the technology had kept improving, but universities had been held back by the \"protection of the brand\" and not wanting to be seen to move away from personal tuition.\n\"It's the perception we need to break, it's not the technology that's been the barrier,\" she said.\nIn terms of supervising exams for distance learners, she said that webcams are \"surprisingly hard to beat\".\nProf Koller said concerns about impersonal online learning were often built on an unrealistic image of traditional campus-based teaching - and that most students are not \"walking on lawns next to ivy-clad buildings\".\n\"It's a false comparison to think it's either anonymous online teaching or else a cosy armchair and individual tutors.\n\"When you have a lecture hall with 300 people, you're not getting personal interaction.\"\nOnline learning should not be compared \"with some utopian ideal of 10 people sitting around in a seminar room engaging deeply with an instructor\".\nProf Koller says that online learning is going to become the route for students who want to improve their qualifications but who cannot afford the time or money to study for a campus-based degree.\n\"Many working adults have obligations, they have a job, a family, a mortgage, they can't go back to school.\"\nIn countries such as India, with ambitious targets to expand higher education, Prof Koller says the authorities will have to use online universities, because there is insufficient capacity in bricks-and-mortar institutions.\nThere are also efforts to use online learning to teach refugees, such as those displaced by Syria's civil war.\nCoursera has announced a partnership with the US State Department to help refugees to access online courses to improve their job chances, such as English language lessons or computer coding.\nIt would remove any costs from studying, such as fees for certificates showing the completion of courses.\nMore stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch\nCoursera was founded four years ago, part of a wave of online university projects that were claimed to be about to revolutionise higher education, making it cheaper and more accessible to students around the world.\nMany millions signed up for free short courses - but Prof Koller is predicting another stage with online learning being incorporated into formal fee-charging degree courses from mainstream universities.\nThere are already many online degrees offered - but Prof Koller says that in the past, such distance learning was seen as something \"respectable universities do not engage in\".\nThere are signs that this change is already beginning to happen.\nThe UK's online university platform, Futurelearn, has announced a project with the University of Leeds, in which course units studied online will count as credits towards an undergraduate degree.\nStudents from this autumn will be able to take course units online and cut the cost of tuition fees for a geography degree.\nPeter Horrocks, chairman of Futurelearn, described this as a \"breakthrough moment\".\nFuturelearn has been created by the Open University, a longstanding provider of degrees by distance learning.\nBut the big change will be if leading, campus-based universities begin to compete for mainstream, undergraduate courses online.\nAnother major US online university network, edX, is launching a project this autumn allowing online course units to be used as building blocks towards a full degree.\nEdX is offering a range of online courses from Arizona State University - and if a student passes eight of these, costing $200 (Â£150) each, it counts as the equivalent of a first year at university.\nCoursera has launched two online postgraduate courses with the University of Illinois, at a much lower price than their conventional counterparts.\nProf Koller says the past four years has seen a rapid rise in the numbers of students wanting to study online, but a slower reaction from universities in offering fully fledged online courses.\n\"We thought that the change in academic institutions would be more rapid,\" she said. \"Universities are not the most nimble of organisations.\"\nThat change could now be approaching, she says, with universities working out their strategies for a potentially huge market.\nThe hype around Moocs might have faded, but the big impact could be about to begin.", "summary": "Leading universities will offer fully accredited undergraduate courses online within five years, says the co-founder of a US online university network.", "id": "36703778"}

But he quickly fell out of favour with the new regime and sought refuge in the UK.\nMr Berezovsky continued to plot against Mr Putin and to be held up as a bogeyman by the Russian media until he was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March this year. Police have said that there is no evidence of anybody else being involved in his death.\nPerhaps most famously Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former head of the now defunct oil company, Yukos, was targeted when (like Mr Navalny) he accused Mr Putin and his associates of conniving in massive corruption.\nHe has subsequently been convicted in two trials of tax evasion and fraud. Following his second trial in 2010, Amnesty International recognised Mr Khodorkovsky and his co-defendant, Platon Lebedev, as \"prisoners of conscience\".\nMr Khodorkovsky is due for release in 2014, but there are signs that he could face further charges.\nPolitical opposition to Mr Putin is becoming an increasingly risky business, with numerous activists facing charges or in jail.\nTwo members of feminist band Pussy Riot are serving two-year prison sentences for \"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred\" after performing an \"anti-Putin punk prayer\" in Moscow's main Orthodox cathedral in February 2012. A third member of the band had her sentence suspended on appeal.\nMeanwhile, criminal charges of affray, incitement to violence and assaulting police officers are pending against more than 20 activists involved in disturbances at a demonstration in Moscow on the eve of Mr Putin's inauguration as president for a third term in May 2012.\nSergei Udaltsov, a left-wing leader of the protest movement, is under house arrest after being charged with incitement to mass disorder on the basis of video evidence shown on Russian TV. If found guilty, Mr Udaltsov (like Mr Navalny) could face a substantial prison sentence.\nSome members of the Russian opposition, such as former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, continue to defy Mr Putin despite regular harassment and detention for public order offences.\nLike Mr Navalny, Mr Nemtsov is a member of the opposition's alternative parliament, the Coordination Council. He is also co-author of a report accusing Mr Putin of leading Russia to ruin.\nAnother member of the Coordination Council, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, has joined the growing list of Russia's political emigres.\nBut, as the fate of former FSB (Federal Security Service) officer Alexander Litvinenko showed, even exile carries risks for Mr Putin's opponents.\nMr Litvinenko died in London in 2006 after being poisoned by radioactive polonium.\nIt is not just oligarchs and politicians who have to fear Putin's disfavour. Journalists and TV presenters, too, have to be wary of offending the Kremlin.\nKsenia Sobchak, whose father Anatoly was Mr Putin's political mentor, was a familiar face on light entertainment shows on Russia TV until she joined the protest movement following the disputed parliamentary election in 2011.\nSince then, her lucrative contracts on mainstream TV have dried up and her appearances have been confined to the niche liberal channel Dozhd - a refuge for several dissident journalists.\nMr Putin makes little secret of his hostility to journalists who challenge his authority.\nShortly after the murder in 2006 of Anna Politkovskaya, a reporter with opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and fierce critic of the Kremlin's policies in Chechnya, Mr Putin dismissed her political influence as \"negligible\".\nMs Politkovskaya is one of five Novaya Gazeta journalists who have been murdered or died in suspicious circumstances since 2000.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

James Taylor continues at number five, but there will be a new-look top three, with Nick Compton poised to play behind Hales and Cook in place of Ian Bell.\nWhile Nottinghamshire's Hales averages only 38 in first-class cricket, he is the only England batsman to have scored hundreds in Twenty20 and one-day internationals, and also made a half-century in the warm-up match against South Africa A.\nHowever, England will face Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel - probably the world's best new-ball pair - on pace-friendly pitches with a top eight where none except Cook and Joe Root have played more than 20 Tests.\nA formidable South Africa side that went nine years and 30 Test series with only two defeats is now also in a state of transition.\nFinding a replacement for all-rounder Jacques Kallis, who retired in 2013, was always likely to be difficult, but the Proteas have also struggled at the top of the order since former captain Graeme Smith quit the following year.\nIt was the batting which failed the Proteas in India, prompting Hashim Amla's side into a reshuffle of their own.\n\"Opening the batting is the most difficult job in Test cricket,\" Amla said. \"Dean Elgar has been very good for us, and Stiaan van Zyl has got the full potential to be a great opener for us.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"It was a tough tour for the openers in India, but then again it was a tough tour for all the batters.\"\nMost significantly, AB de Villiers has been asked to keep wicket in order to find space for another batsman.\nDe Villiers is ranked as the third best Test batsman in the world and Amla seventh, but England will be targeting the rest of a top seven that is either inexperienced or out of form.\nThe home side are boosted by Steyn's recovery from a groin injury, but Vernon Philander is out with an ankle problem.\n\"The way Dale has been bowling in the nets has been unbelievable,\" Amla said. \"He's been the best bowler in the world for many years. We're really glad to have him back.\"\nEngland have visited South Africa four times since the Proteas returned to the international fold, with each tour proving memorable for a variety of reasons.\nEngland's 1-0 defeat in 1995-96 was the tour in which Michael Atherton batted for nearly 11 hours to earn a draw in Johannesburg, while South Africa's 2-1 win four years later included the 'leather jacket Test', when disgraced former Proteas captain Hansie Cronje was paid to corruptly ensure that the fifth Test did not end in a draw.\nIn 2004-05, Michael Vaughan's England secured a 2-1 win that preceded their Ashes triumph, while the one-day leg of the trip saw Kevin Pietersen score three centuries despite abuse from the crowds in the country of his birth.\nSix years ago, on England's most recent South Africa tour, they escaped with a 1-1 series draw after number 11 Graham Onions twice saw off the final over of the match to earn two draws.\nBBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew\n\"There's no question England are confident of pulling off their second unexpected success of the year, but they will have to bat better than they did while winning the Ashes.\n\"The batting is the battleground of the series, with South Africa's line-up losing a lot of confidence in their defeat in India, which resulted in both frontline spinners being dropped and AB de Villiers returning to keep wicket.\n\"England also came unstuck against Pakistan but both teams will prefer the conditions that await them in these four Tests.\n\"South Africa's pace attack will target Alex Hales, who has to prove he has the technique and temperament to cope with high-class new-ball bowling.

{"document": "The local authority involved, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, rejected a report in the Times newspaper that said the foster family did not speak English. It also disputed other details. Reporting restrictions are in place to protect the identity of the girl.\nReality Check has been looking at the rules around fostering children and what happens in practice.\nAccording to the fostering agency Tact Care, while Muslim families do occasionally foster non-Muslim children, it is less usual for non-Muslim families to foster Muslim children.\nThere are no official statistics available on the religion of fostered children or their carers, but we do have some information about ethnicity.\nGovernment figures show nine local authorities reported having no long-term foster carers from minority ethnic groups last year, but all reported placing minority ethnic children with their fostering service.\nIn 2015-16, 84% of long-term foster carers were white compared with about 77% of fostered children.\nFoster carers can access training and are expected to demonstrate how they are meeting the legal standards of care. For example, someone caring for a vulnerable child will have to provide evidence that they understand the principle of \"equality, inclusion and anti-discriminatory practice\".\nWhen a child needs to be accommodated in a foster placement, a council usually has less than 24 hours to find them a home, meaning there is often not a lot of choice between which approved foster carer they are placed with. There are other considerations, too, like making sure the child is near their school.\nThere are very few hard and fast rules dictating who can become a foster carer. Each individual applying to care for vulnerable children has to undergo a comprehensive assessment by a council or independent fostering agency.\nThis can take about 15-20 weeks, during which they will be expected to allow their home, lifestyle, current and past relationships to be scrutinised.\nThe basic criteria required by most fostering agencies and councils are:\nAge, marital status, ethnicity and sexuality will not exclude someone from being a foster carer. But some of these elements may be taken into account, depending on the individual circumstances - the primary consideration is what is best for the child.\nSo, for example, the charity The Fostering Network says a single person can foster but must demonstrate that they have an adequate support network. And a person's religion won't prevent them from fostering but they will need to demonstrate how they can support a child of a different religion from their own.\nThe principles are set out in law in the Children Act 1989, which says: \"Foster carers and fostering services should ensure that full attention is paid to the individual child's gender, faith, ethnic origin, cultural and linguistic background, sexual orientation and any disability they might have\" and foster carers must be \"informed, trained and confident\" at dealing with these issues.\nThis doesn't mean foster carers must necessarily be of the same ethnic or faith background as the children they care for, but they must be equipped to meet that child's cultural and religious needs.\nBefore 2014 there was a principle in adoption that children should be matched with families of the same ethnic background as their own where possible, but this requirement to give \"due consideration\" to things like race was removed because of concerns that it was preventing children from being placed with suitable families of different backgrounds.\nThere was no corresponding principle for fostering.\nRead more from Reality Check\nFollow us on Twitter", "summary": "A judge in the case of a five-year-old Christian girl who was placed with a Muslim foster family has ruled she should live with her grandmother.", "id": "41094254"}

{"document": "That bargain could have backfired in a way that was neither good for his golf nor his social standing. Thankfully for the Spieth family, the lure of the clubs was too strong to resist. Eighteen years on, the obsessive kid has become a record-breaking champion.\nBen Crenshaw, another Masters winner schooled in the high winds and heat of Texas, has spoken of looking into the 21-year-old's eyes and seeing the dead-eyed stare of Wild West gunslinger Wyatt Earp.\nThe final day here at Augusta is often a shoot-out. The pressures of the back nine - greens like glass, fairways steep and narrow, water, water everywhere - have broken older men with far greater experience of these beautiful and brutal yards.\nSpieth admitted afterwards that he had struggled to sleep on Saturday night, self-effacingly pointing to his prematurely receding hairline as an indication of the stress he has been under.\nYet even with so many big guns lurking - world number one Rory McIlroy, three-times Masters champion Phil Mickelson, major winner Justin Rose - the callow kid never looked like backing down.\nIf it seemed less thrilling a finale than we have come to expect from Augusta, it is worth a reminder of the dramatic context: the second youngest winner in Masters history, the first to go to 19 under (before a bogey on the last), more birdies across his four rounds than any player here has ever made, the first man to win it wire to wire in 39 years.\nFor those who have become desensitised to the scale of his achievement by the very fact that he had led so handsomely throughout, this might help: Rose and Mickelson's score of 14 under for second would have have been the winning tally in all bar five of the previous 78 Masters that have been played.\nSpieth has always been aimed at this day. He won the US Junior Amateur title twice (something only Tiger Woods had ever done before), tied for 16th in the Byron Nelson Championship as a 16-year-old (better than Woods ever managed as an amateur in a PGA Tour event) and became the youngest PGA Tour winner in 82 years when he won the John Deere Classic aged 19 years and 11 months.\nThere is footage of him aged 14 declaring that his ultimate goal in life is to win the Masters. Goals like that are supposed to be good for young sportsmen. They also bring their own burden.\nOut on the course, beery breath and cigar smoke swirling in the cool breeze, there were groans and gasps when his overnight lead of four strokes was cut to three at only the second hole and again at the seventh.\nSo locked in tradition is Augusta that no radios, phones or tablets are allowed through the gates, which preserves a certain atmosphere but also creates its own strange drama.\nHow was Spieth doing? Was Mickelson closing, was Woods - full of promise of a charge through the front nine - rampaging along as of old?\nThe only indication, for both players and patrons alike, is first when a volley of noise rolls in through the pine trees from a distant hole and then when the large wooden scoreboards are slowly adjusted by a troupe of men climbing up ladders, like stagehands dressing a particularly elaborate set.\nThis sort of information vacuum frays the nerves of those watching, let alone a 21-year-old within touching distance of his greatest ambition.\nFirst a hole appears on the board next to the name of the player. Everyone turns and stares. Then, with minimal regard for the anxiety all around, an official will slowly insert a new numbered board.\nThat was how Spieth found out that Mickelson was slipping, that McIlroy was improving too slowly, that Woods - name taken off the board entirely - was not the danger of old.\nSpieth would not give them a breath of hope.\nBy the 10th - Rose three-putting the ninth - the lead was back to five. In the pine needles on 11, he bumped and ran beautifully to the right of the green before flicking on a wedge that stopped as if he had it on string.\nThe crowds here were willing a Mickelson miracle. No-one is loved in these parts in the same way. Mickelson's avuncular grin, relaxed physique and famed generosity (few waitresses leave Phil's table less than $100 better off) have made him some sort of utopian Everyman for the American golf fan.\nSpieth's display rendered it instead first a procession and then a coronation.\nAs he slipped on his first Green Jacket, with all the awkwardness that this sometimes painfully corny ceremony can offer, thoughts wandered off already to where he might go next.\nThese debut grand triumphs are a lovely stage for a young sportsman, a point in time where everything seems possible, the future unchecked by the vagaries of injury, form or motivation.\nSpieth is still young enough to do exactly what his mother tells him - which is a good thing, when she spots you rather lost for words on the 18th green and tells you to congratulate your playing partner and thank the whooping crowd.\nIt is a potent reminder of Woods at the same age, winning his debut Masters by exactly the same score and in the same nerveless fashion.\nIt would take Woods almost two and-a-half years to win his next major. He would reach world number one rather sooner, within two months of his breakthrough at Augusta, and with Spieth already up to second in the rankings that particular piece of history may well repeat.\nIt was easy to pick out what made the young Woods stand out - his huge driving, a power game that would cause even this living museum of golf to be radically altered.\nEven Spieth has trouble describing the best part of his own game, settling on the rather more prosaic \"playing badly well\" - what others would call course management and precocious self-control.\nCrenshaw, poetic in his Masters farewell, spoke of a \"jeweller's touch\". That does rather better in illustrating how beautifully precise Spieth was in adorning these greens with his short game.\nThe only man who has putted like this at Augusta is Woods.

Who sits on them and how successful have they been?\nBBC Scotland's business and economy editor Douglas Fraser has heard from one veteran of these task forces who described them as \"largely useless\".\nThis was set up at the start of October \"to support workers and communities affected by Young's Seafood's decision to reduce its operations in the town\".\nThe move followed a decision by Sainsbury's to transfer a Â£100m fish processing contract away from Young's, resulting in the loss of 650 jobs.\nThe business minister said after its first meeting on 2 October: \"The Task Force will also consider how to support longer term sustainable employment in the wider area.\n\"This work will take a number of months and all members of the Task Force agreed today to collaborate closely to deliver an Economic Recovery Plan that meets the needs and aspirations of the workers, the people of Fraserburgh and surrounding communities.\"\nThe Fraserburgh team is made up of representatives of Young's, the Usdaw union, Scottish Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland, Aberdeenshire Council, local MPs and MSPs.\nAlso taking their place around the table are Highlands & Islands Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland, the Department of Work and Pensions, the Scottish Seafood Association, the Scottish Pelagic Processors Association and Seafood Scotland.\nAn emergency summit was convened in Edinburgh on 11 September at which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland stood ready to take at least 1,000 new refugees \"as an immediate priority\".\nRepresented on the task force are the Scottish and UK governments, Scottish Refugee Council, British Red Cross, Glasgow Girls, STUC, New Scots, City of Edinburgh Council, Cosla, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, the DWP and Police Scotland.\nFollowing the meeting, the Scottish government's Europe Minister Humza Yousaf said: \"It is very encouraging to hear that the majority of councils have indicated a willingness to accommodate refugees - we will now build on this positive response and ensure the appropriate support and integration services are put in place.\"\nEstablished by Richard Lochhead, Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, this was tasked with \"supporting delivery of the Scottish government's commitment to tackling environmental crime\".\nThe task force, which presented its findings to the Scottish government in June 2013, said it had looked to \"define environmental crime, identify opportunities and priorities for preventing, tackling and deterring environmental crime, improve co-ordination between law enforcement agencies and others and make proposals for legislation, research and other measures to tackle environmental crime\".\nIt was made up of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, the Scottish government's Environmental Quality Division, Justice department and Natural Resources Division, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers (UK).\nIn March, Scottish Power announced plans to close its huge coal-fired power station at Longannet in Fife early next year.\nThe move came after the energy firm failed to win a crucial contract from the National Grid.\nThe Longannet Task Force, again chaired by Fergus Ewing, met on 24 August and was made up of local MPs and MSPs, trades unions, businesses and government agencies.\nIt will reconvene next month once final figures have been produced to show how many Longannet employees want to take redundancy, seek redeployment within the company or find a new job.\nHugh Finlay, Scottish Power's generation director, said: \"The taskforce continues to make good progress and all parties around the table are working closely together to put forward a viable economic plan for the region.

{"document": "The RDG, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said it was the smallest annual rise for six years.\nRegulated fares, which include season tickets, are capped at no more than July's RPI inflation rate of 1%.\nUnregulated fares, such as off-peak leisure tickets, can go up by as much as the train companies like.\nRDG chief Paul Plummer said: \"We know that nobody likes to pay more to travel by train, especially to get to work.\"\nBut he added that money from fares now almost covers rail's daily operating costs.\n\"This allows government to focus its funding on building a bigger, better network when the railway is becoming increasingly important at driving economic growth, underpinning jobs, and connecting friends and families,\" Mr Plummer said.\nUnder government rules, the rise in regulated fares was restricted to no more than the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation over the year to July, which was 1%. Over the long term, RPI has tended to record higher inflation than the other measure of rising prices, the Consumer Price Index, which was 0.1% during the year.\nThe increases cover fares in England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland is treated separately.\nMartin Abrams, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said more must be done to achieve a \"truly affordable railway\" as fares have risen by more than 25% in the last five years.\n\"To avoid pricing people off the railways, the train operating companies and the government need to work closely together to provide fairer, simpler and cheaper fares through flexible ticketing and making sure people are always sold the cheapest ticket available.\"\nMr Abrams insisted it was \"simply unfair\" that flexible ticketing has not yet been introduced, leading many part-time workers to \"fork out for five-day season tickets which don't give them the same savings that full-time commuters get\".\nRail Minister Claire Perry claimed the government's decision to link regulated fare increases to no more than RPI will save the average season ticket holder £425 by 2020.\nShe added: \"Our plan for passengers is improving journeys for everyone. It's transforming the tickets people buy, how much they pay for them, the trains they sit on, how quickly they arrive and the stations they arrive in.\"\nBut Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said the rise was \"another kick in the teeth for the British passenger who is already paying some of the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped out and overcrowded trains\".\nThe increase would help ring-fence the profits of \"rip-off private rail companies who, once again, will be laughing all the way to the bank\".\nToday's rise is the smallest since 2010 and even that was a one-off blip before an election.\nRegulated fares have actually raced up by around 40% in the past decade, taking season tickets around the south east of England well into the £4,000-£5,000 mark.\nThe whole point of letting the government regulate half our fares was to protect customers from big hikes by the train companies. They picked out the kind of tickets where people don't have much choice but to go by train.

{"document": "Yet for some chocolate firms the fact that most Easter eggs are hollow is more than just disappointing, it's problematic.\n\"It sounds ridiculous, but there is a lot of air in Easter eggs relative to their value in weight,\" says Helen Pattinson, co-founder of boutique British chocolate chain Montezuma's.\nThe oval shape of eggs and the boxes required to keep them intact means that, compared to the amount of space they take up in a shipping container, it is impossible for Montezuma's to charge the end customer enough to make a decent profit.\nForeign sales account for about a fifth of the company's overall sales and for this financial year, ending in May, it expects exports to hit the £1m mark for the first time.\nDespite the strong demand from abroad, the firm is yet to send its chocolate eggs overseas.\n\"The economics just haven't added up so far,\" says Mrs Pattinson, who co-founded the firm in 2000 with her husband Simon.\nThe company has six shops in the South East of England and sells directly to customers in the US and Europe via its website, and further afield via export arrangements. So far most of its overseas customers have come via a partnership deal with a large US retailer.\nDespite the more established reputation of Swiss and Belgian chocolatiers, Mrs Pattinson says she is seeing a growing demand for British-made chocolate.\n\"The most contemporary artisan foodies are beginning to realise Britain is a fantastic producer of chocolate,\" she says.\nLast year, the UK exported a whopping £245m worth of chocolate, up by almost a quarter on 2015.\nExports of unfilled chocolates and chocolate products, which include Easter eggs, totalled just over £30m, up 3% on 2015. While the vast majority of these went to EU countries, the biggest growth was in exports to non-EU countries which increased by almost a fifth, according to the Department for International Trade.\nIt is a trend that hasn't escaped the notice of Sean Ramsden, chief executive of Ramsden International.\nThe family firm specialises in exporting British food overseas and Mr Ramsden says Easter is its busiest period after Christmas.\nThe awkward shape of chocolate eggs isn't a problem for the company because it supplies a much wider range of products, enabling it to mix Easter eggs with other food orders.\n\"Easter eggs are a popular UK product and they're very exportable. They [Easter eggs] are not as advanced in other countries,\" he says.\nWhen the Grimsby-based firm first started exporting in 1970, business was largely driven by expats. Marmite, brown sauce and baked beans were the items most in demand in the company's markets in Spain, Portugal, France, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong.\nNow it delivers to 130 countries and turnover last year was £50m. Mr Ramsden says the company's growth reflects demand from a growing global middle class.\n\"The food becomes premium by virtue of being imported. There is an element of snob value in certain markets,\" he says.\nParticularly in Asia, he says, customers are keen to have \"something a little bit different or a bit more exclusive\" such as a foreign brand.\nBut he says many of its customers also have an international outlook, with second homes in the UK, for example, and a genuine affection for British food.\nSharan Gill, who lives in Hong Kong, says she always buys imported chocolate eggs for her children at Easter.\n\"It's a tradition amongst my friends too, both Western and Asian. I spend between 100 to 150 Hong Kong dollars (£10-£15; $13-$19) on chocolates for the annual Easter egg hunt, which my kids thoroughly enjoy.\n\"Easter seems to be a growing trend, partly because clubs and restaurants promote it extensively.\n\"Plus Hong Kong has a large expat community, a large proportion of which consists of Westerners, for whom Easter is an established tradition.

{"document": "However his role as used-car salesman Arthur Daley, in the long-running TV series Minder, is the one for which he will be best remembered.\nHis character became synonymous with dodgy dealing and phrases such as \"nice little earner\" and \"er indoors\" passed  into the national lexicon.\nAs well as his numerous screen appearances, he also starred for 15 years in the BBC radio series A Life of Bliss, later adapted for TV.\nGeorge Edward Cole was born in Tooting, south-west London  on 22 Apr 1925. His 16 year old mother abandoned him when he was just ten days old and he was adopted by the Cole family and  brought up on a London council estate.\nHe left school at 14 intending to work as a butcher's boy but,  following the death of his adoptive father, ran away to Blackpool where he successfully auditioned for a part in a touring musical show.\nIn 1940, he played a Cockney evacuee in Cottage To Let, first on stage and then on film. He had gone to the audition for the stage version purely to accompany a friend but ended up getting the part himself.\n\"I was always in plays at school and in school concerts,\" he said. \"You could say I liked to show off.\"\nTogether with his adoptive mother, he was taken in by the  actor Alistair Sim and his wife, Naomi, and appeared with Sim in a number of plays.\nThe Sims ruthlessly worked on ironing out his cockney vowels, determined that he shouldn't be type-cast.\nCole joined the RAF in 1943, where he trained as a wireless operator. When it was discovered that his eyesight wasn't good he was removed from flying duties and transferred to Coastal Command HQ in Northwood before going to Allied occupied Germany to run the bar in an officers' mess.\nAfter the war he returned to acting and, by his late 20s, was a veteran of more than 30 films, few of them memorable, including a role as the love interest of a newly-emerging starlet called Joan Collins, in the 1951 film Bikini Babe.\nHe did have a small role in Laurence Olivier's epic production of Henry V and was, at the time of his death, the last survivor of the huge cast.\nIn 1953, he took over the role of David Bliss, the somewhat bumbling bachelor in the BBC radio comedy, A Life of Bliss. The series ran for 118 episodes, transferring briefly to television in the early 1960s.\nIt was the 1954 film, The Belles of St Trinian's that brought him to the attention of a  wider audience and, incidentally, allowed him to establish the character of the cockney rogue that he would later portray in Minder.\nAs the spiv, Flash Harry, he was a ready source of nylons for the girls in the school and drink for the teachers. The film featured his mentor, Alistair Sim in the dual roles of the headmistress and her crooked brother.\nHe would go on to reprise the role in Blue Murder at St Trinian's in 1957, Blue Murder at St Trinian's in 1960 and The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery in 1966.\nHe was seldom out of work, proving to be a versatile performer who could turn his hand to serious roles, as in The Inspector Calls and musicals like It's a Wonderful World.\nThere was a minor role in the Taylor/Burton version of Cleopatra in 1963 and he even turned his hand to horror in the 1970s, with The Vampire Lovers, which shocked many with its lesbian love scenes.\nThe following year, in another horror film, Fright, he found himself working alongside a young actor named Dennis Waterman - later to star alongside him in Minder.\nCole was also shortlisted for the part of the butler, Hudson, in the London Weekend period drama, Upstairs, Downstairs, a role that eventually went to Gordon Jackson.\nHe remained much in demand appearing in a variety of roles. These included playing the  potter, Josiah Wedgewood in a BBC drama, The Voyage of Charles Darwin and the unscrupulous MP, Sir Giles Lynchwood, in the BBC adaptation of Tom Sharpe's novel, Blott on the Landscape.\nIn one scene of the latter production his character, a secret fetishist,  was left naked, trussed and bound on a bed by a  good natured, but particularly forgetful call girl, memorably played by Julia McKenzie.\nHe also played the author, George Maple, in the BBC sitcom, Don't Forget to Write\nIn 1979 he was offered the part of Arthur Daley in a comedy-drama called Minder, a role that would come to define his career.\nThe character reflected the entrepreneurial era of Thatcher's Britain. \"In an era of greed, he was fairly greedy, but also so unsuccessful,\" Cole once recalled. \"He had the appeal of the eternal loser.\"\nOriginally written as a vehicle for Dennis Waterman, Cole was not the first choice for the part but Waterman's preference for the actor, Denholm Eliot, was overruled by the producers, much to Waterman's annoyance.\n\"We circled round each other for three or four days,\" Cole later recalled. But the pair soon became close friends and developed a rapport on set that saw them improvising scenes to good effect.\nThe drama ran for eleven series, with Gary Webster replacing Dennis Waterman as Terry in 1991, and delivered huge ratings figures for ITV.\nIt also made Cole an unlikely pop star when  his duet with Dennis Waterman, \"What Are We Gonna Get 'Er Indoors?\", reached the UK Top Thirty in 1983.\nAlthough Cole was approaching 70 when Minder finally ended, he continued to work regularly into the new century with guest appearances in a number of series, including Midsomer Murders, and various film roles.\nHe married the actress Eileen Moore in 1954 and the couple had two children. They divorced in 1962 after she left him for someone else. Cole subsequently married another actress, Penny Morrell\nA genial and warm-hearted man, Cole always had mixed feelings about the wheeler-dealer character that had brought him fame and fortune.\n\"I've earned a few sovs from him over the years, so I shouldn't complain, but he was a rogue; a dreadful character, really. I'd certainly lock up the silver if he was coming to dinner.\"", "summary": "George Cole was a veteran of more than 60 films in a career that spanned eight decades.", "id": "13037771"}

{"document": "Victory in the Cold War made it the hegemon in a unipolar world.\nFew argued when the 20th Century was dubbed the \"American Century\", a term first coined in the early 1940s when the country was still overcoming its isolationist instincts.\nEven the New Year's fireworks, which illuminated the obelisk of the Washington Monument in a way that made it resemble a giant number one, projected the country's supremacy as the world's sole superpower.\nOver the past 15 years, America's fortunes have changed with dizzying speed.\nFirst came the tremors: the dot-com bust and a disputed presidential election in 2000. Then came the massive convulsions: the destruction of the Twin Towers in 2001 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.\nLong wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have exacted an enormous blood price - the lives of 6,852 American military personnel - not to mention immense financial expense, estimated to be as high as $6 trillion (Â£3.9tn).\nThe detention centre at Guantanamo Bay has undermined American ideals, just as the NSA and Wikileaks spying scandals have undercut American diplomacy.\nGeorge W Bush, a president with a Manichean worldview, was widely seen as over-eager to project America's military might, without adequately considering the long-term consequences.\nBarack Obama, who campaigned in 2008 on a platform of extricating America from its unpopular and exhausting wars, has drawn criticism for disengaging too much.\nUnder both presidents - the first an impulsive unilateralist, the second an instinctive multilateralist content sometimes to lead from behind - America's global standing has been diminished.\nPolls regularly show that Americans recognise that their country's international standing has waned.\nAmong the young, this trendline has fallen sharply. Only 15% of 18-29-year-olds believe that America is the \"greatest country in the world\", according to Pew, down from 27% in 2011.\nTellingly, however, there has been no great public outcry.\nNo longer is there much appetite for America playing its long-standing role of global policeman, even in the face of the rise of the group calling itself Islamic State.\nThe cost, human and financial, is considered too great. Americans increasingly think that other countries should share the burden.\nObama, while continuing to trumpet \"American exceptionalism\", regularly prefaces remarks on foreign affairs by acknowledging the limits of US power, again with little public outcry.\nThe upshot is that the United States is no longer so keen to exert leadership in an increasingly messy world.\nYet one of the reasons why the world has become so disorderly is because America is no longer so active in imposing order.\nOver the course of this century Washington has lost its fear factor.\nWorld leaders nowadays seem prepared to provoke the wrath of the White House, confident that it will never rain down on them.\nIt explains why the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, after unleashing chemical weapons against his people, continues to bombard them with barrel bombs.\nWhy Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea, and also offered a safe haven for the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\nAnd also why Benjamin Netanyahu thumbed his nose at the Obama administration, by accepting an invitation from the Republican congressional leadership to address a joint session of Congress, a platform he used to lambast the Iran nuclear deal.\nAssad's flouting of American warnings is especially noteworthy.\nIn killing so many civilians with chemical weapons, he flagrantly crossed the \"red line\" imposed by Obama, but escaped punishment.\nThe president was unwilling to carry through on an explicit threat, in what was the biggest foreign policy climbdown of his presidency and also one of the most significant in the past 50 years.\nEven supporters of Barack Obama believe he made a fatal strategic mistake, because it demonstrated endless flexibility and a lack of American resolve.\nNeedless to say, despots around the world took note.\nAmerica's reluctance to launch new military actions has also had a major bearing on the nuclear negotiations with Iran.\nTehran has managed to extract notable concessions, such as the ongoing ability to enrich uranium, hitherto ruled out by the Americans.\nIt has played a weak hand strongly, because it knows that America has what the foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman calls \"an empty holster\".\nNor is it just America's enemies who no longer fear the White House to the extent they once did.\nIn recent months, two close allies, Britain and Australia, have defied the Obama administration by joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\nBy signing up to the AIIB, they are effectively endorsing Beijing's effort to establish financial rivals to the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), which are dominated by America.\nBy seeking improved commercial and diplomatic relations with China, Britain and Australia are also hedging.\nThey suspect that America will not be the dominant Pacific military power indefinitely, nor the world's foremost economic powerhouse.\nOther American allies would complain that the \"dependability factor\" has also gone.\nIsrael feels badly let down by the Obama administration over the Iran deal, and relations between Benjamin Netanyahu and Barack Obama are poisonous.\nThe president, by using deliberately ambiguous language, has even signalled that his administration might end its traditional protection of Israel at the United Nations.\nLike Israel, Saudi Arabia has been enraged by the prospective nuclear deal with the Iranians.\nRiyadh also knows that America is no longer so dependent on its oil, the cornerstone of the relationship since the end of World War Two.\nEgypt was angered in 2012 when Obama said Cairo was neither an ally nor an enemy.\nLater, the State Department issued an embarrassing correction, and reinstated Cairo as a \"major non-Nato ally.\"\nMaybe Obama's Egyptian error, and the slight it conveyed, was truly a Freudian slip.\nAfter all, he hasn't invested the same energy nurturing alliances as his predecessors. The detached air that has been a hallmark of his presidency also extends to foreign affairs.\nHere, I gather, Obama recognises intellectually that he could do far more in terms of massaging the egos of world leaders, but cannot quite bring himself to do so.\nIndeed, a common complaint is that the Obama administration has prioritised normalising relations with its one-time enemies, Iran and Cuba, at the expense of fostering longstanding friendships.\nRealising that America is no longer so supportive, and no longer so engaged in the Middle East, the Saudis have recently taken military action of their own in Yemen.\nThere's also been a warming of relations between Riyadh and Moscow.\nAnd Egypt launched airstrikes in February against the Islamic State group in Libya.\nAmerica's standing in the Middle East has unquestionably waned, along with its ability to shape events.\nMore surprising has been its slippage in Africa, Obama's ancestral home, and Asia, the focus of his much vaunted pivot.\nIn Asia, America's median approval rating in 2014, as measured by Gallup, was 39%, a 6% drop since 2011.\nIn Africa, the median approval went down to 59%, the lowest since polling began, despite Obama hosting the US-Africa Leaders' Summit in Washington in August, last year.\nIt even dropped in Kenya, his father's birthplace.\nAmerica's diplomacy has also been complicated by the dysfunction and hyper-partisanship in Washington.\nRepublican lawmakers actively sought to derail the Iran nuclear deal by sending a letter to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nHouse speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu to address Congress, knowing it would infuriate the White House.\nDemocrats with reservations about free trade have tried to sabotage the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the biggest trade deal since Nafta.\nThere's also been strong congressional opposition to one of the big plays of Obama's second term, the rapprochement with Cuba.\nShould countries listen to the president or Congress?\nAmerica cannot even lay claim any more to its great, uncontested boast since 1872, of being the world's largest economy.\nThe IMF now estimates that China's economy is fractionally bigger.\nYet it would be a mistake to exaggerate the downsizing of American influence.\nUS military spending continues to dwarf its rivals, and up until last year amounted to more than the next 10 countries combined.\nIn 2014, America spent $731bn, compared to China's $143bn.\nEven though China's economy is now larger, America's per capita spending power is in a different league - $53,000 to $11,868.\nThough America is contending with the rise of the rest - China, India, Brazil, Germany and Russia - it has not yet been overtaken by emergent rivals.\nIndeed, there are foreign policy thinkers here who predict that America will preserve its pre-eminence for at least another 20 years.\nYet the unipolar moment ushered in by the fall of the Berlin Wall has proved to be just that: momentary.\nMoreover, hopes of a new world order following the collapse of the Soviet Union have given way to widespread pessimism about the spread, even the contagion, of global disorder.\nGone are the certainties of America's Cold War thinking, when the containment of communism governed its international actions.\nGone are the doctrines that gave US foreign policy such a rigid frame, throughout the Cold War and in the aftermath of 9/11.\nGone, too, is the notion that every fight is an American fight and along with it a redefinition of what constitutes the US national interest.\nBarack Obama has instead advocated pragmatism and diplomatic dexterity, trying to steer a path between America being overextended and undercommitted.\nMaybe the overriding challenge for US diplomacy over the next 20 years is to strike the proper balance.", "summary": "Standing on the Washington Mall at the turn of the new millennium, it was impossible not to be struck by America's power and global pre-eminence.", "id": "33440287"}

Are we not way above that?\"\nGood shot, Rand, but thwack came the response - \"I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there,\" said Trump.\nCue laughter. Next up into the ring was Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. \"Mr Trump.

Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\"\nShe was stoic and measured: \"I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump said.\" And Trump was now visibly back-pedalling. \"I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman.\"\nHer face was acid.

It was a gotcha moment.\nAnd \"low energy\" Jeb Bush - as Donald Trump dubbed him -  achieved something similar when he gave a Trump a good kicking over the tycoon bringing Bush's Mexican-born wife into the political debate.\nTrump looked defensive. He wouldn't give the apology that Bush demanded, but he was discomfited.\nThere was a lot of serious stuff in this sprawling three hour debate.

{"document": "Dear President Tusk\nOn 23 June last year, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. As I have said before, that decision was no rejection of the values we share as fellow Europeans. Nor was it an attempt to do harm to the European Union or any of the remaining member states. On the contrary, the United Kingdom wants the European Union to succeed and prosper. Instead, the referendum was a vote to restore, as we see it, our national self-determination. We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe - and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.\nEarlier this month, the United Kingdom Parliament confirmed the result of the referendum by voting with clear and convincing majorities in both of its Houses for the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. The Bill was passed by Parliament on 13 March and it received Royal Assent from Her Majesty The Queen and became an Act of Parliament on 16 March.\nToday, therefore, I am writing to give effect to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom. I hereby notify the European Council in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Union. In addition, in accordance with the same Article 50(2) as applied by Article 106a of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, I hereby notify the European Council of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community. References in this letter to the European Union should therefore be taken to include a reference to the European Atomic Energy Community.\nSee the letter as published by Downing Street (PDF)\nThis letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty's Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy - as your closest friend and neighbour - with the European Union once we leave. We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too.\nIt is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side. We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from security threats. We want the United Kingdom, through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union, to play its full part in achieving these goals. We therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union.\nThe Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition, giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union - and indeed from third countries around the world - as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.\nI would like to propose some principles that may help to shape our coming discussions, but before I do so, I should update you on the process we will be undertaking at home, in the United Kingdom.\nAs I have announced already, the Government will bring forward legislation that will repeal the Act of Parliament - the European Communities Act 1972 - that gives effect to EU law in our country. This legislation will, wherever practical and appropriate, in effect convert the body of existing European Union law (the \"acquis\") into UK law.  This means there will be certainty for UK citizens and for anybody from the European Union who does business in the United Kingdom. The Government will consult on how we design and implement this legislation, and we will publish a White Paper tomorrow. We also intend to bring forward several other pieces of legislation that address specific issues relating to our departure from the European Union, also with a view to ensuring continuity and certainty, in particular for businesses. We will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the European Union, and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave.\nFrom the start and throughout the discussions, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, taking due account of the specific interests of every nation and region of the UK as we do so. When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration.\nThe United Kingdom wants to agree with the European Union a deep and special partnership that takes in both economic and security cooperation. To achieve this, we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\nIf, however, we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms. In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened. In this kind of scenario, both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change, but it is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome.\nIt is for these reasons that we want to be able to agree a deep and special partnership, taking in both economic and security cooperation, but it is also because we want to play our part in making sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.  And we want the United Kingdom to play its full part in realising that vision for our continent.\nLooking ahead to the discussions which we will soon begin, I would like to suggest some principles that we might agree to help make sure that the process is as smooth and successful as possible.\ni. We should engage with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation. Since I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I have listened carefully to you, to my fellow EU Heads of Government and the Presidents of the European Commission and Parliament. That is why the United Kingdom does not seek membership of the single market: we understand and respect your position that the four freedoms of the single market are indivisible and there can be no \"cherry picking\". We also understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU: we know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy. We also know that UK companies will, as they trade within the EU, have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part - just as UK companies do in other overseas markets.\nii. We should always put our citizens first. There is obvious complexity in the discussions we are about to undertake, but we should remember that at the heart of our talks are the interests of all our citizens. There are, for example, many citizens of the remaining member states living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union, and we should aim to strike an early agreement about their rights.\niii. We should work towards securing a comprehensive agreement.  We want to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation. We will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom's continuing partnership with the EU. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\niv. We should work together to minimise disruption and give as much certainty as possible. Investors, businesses and citizens in both the UK and across the remaining 27 member states - and those from third countries around the world - want to be able to plan. In order to avoid any cliff-edge as we move from our current relationship to our future partnership, people and businesses in both the UK and the EU would benefit from implementation periods to adjust in a smooth and orderly way to new arrangements. It would help both sides to minimise unnecessary disruption if we agree this principle early in the process.\nv. In particular, we must pay attention to the UK's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom. We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland. We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement.\nvi. We should begin technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, but we should prioritise the biggest challenges. Agreeing a high-level approach to the issues arising from our withdrawal will of course be an early priority.  But we also propose a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. This should be of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it so that it covers sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries. This will require detailed technical talks, but as the UK is an existing EU member state, both sides have regulatory frameworks and standards that already match. We should therefore prioritise how we manage the evolution of our regulatory frameworks to maintain a fair and open trading environment, and how we resolve disputes.  On the scope of the partnership between us - on both economic and security matters - my officials will put forward detailed proposals for deep, broad and dynamic cooperation.\nvii. We should continue to work together to advance and protect our shared European values. Perhaps now more than ever, the world needs the liberal, democratic values of Europe.  We want to play our part to ensure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.\nAs I have said, the Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation.  At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world, Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens. Likewise, Europe's security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake. The United Kingdom's objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my Lancaster House speech of 17 January and the subsequent White Paper published on 2 February.\nWe recognise that it will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the Treaty. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. We start from a unique position in these discussions - close regulatory alignment, trust in one another's institutions, and a spirit of cooperation stretching back decades. It is for these reasons, and because the future partnership between the UK and the EU is of such importance to both sides, that I am sure it can be agreed in the time period set out by the Treaty.\nThe task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us. After all, the institutions and the leaders of the European Union have succeeded in bringing together a continent blighted by war into a union of peaceful nations, and supported the transition of dictatorships to democracy. Together, I know we are capable of reaching an agreement about the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, while establishing a deep and special partnership that contributes towards the prosperity, security and global power of our continent.\nYours sincerely\nTheresa May", "summary": "Here is the full text of Theresa May's letter to European Council president Donald Tusk, beginning the start of Brexit negotiations.", "id": "39431070"}

Made a really important save from Tom Rogic soon after Celtic had clawed it back to 2-2. That was a huge moment and then he saved from Scott Brown in the shootout.\nJames Tavernier (defender) 7\nEverybody questioned him defensively beforehand, but he answered them all. Only once did he revert to fouling Patrick Roberts and he didn't give Gary Mackay-Steven a sniff when faced with him. Also kept attacking throughout, although it was a tired penalty kick he missed in the shootout.\nRob Kiernan (defender) 7\nShowed great composure at times during the game, bringing the ball down and playing it out of dangerous areas with passing triangles. Didn't play with any fear before his injury and was solid defensively.\nDanny Wilson (defender) 8\nHas improved in recent months and that showed in this game. He took charge at the back and showed maturity and composure throughout. Handled the difficult challenge of facing Griffiths well.\nLee Wallace (defender) 8\nHis energy levels were remarkable. In the first half, he and Barrie McKay were excellent as a pairing. Wallace had to defend well against Roberts, but kept to his strengths and was always bombing forward. Even in extra time he was running beyond McKay to make things happen, and was strong defensively. A consummate pro and played a captain's role.\nAndy Halliday (midfielder) 7\nScott Brown dominated the midfield in last season's Old Firm game, but Halliday stood up to him, got tackles in and got the fans going. He also showed a good range of passing. Set the tone for Rangers early on with his energy and assertiveness and took responsibility by scoring Rangers' opening penalty in the shootout.\nDominic Ball (midfielder) 7\nPlayed in the holding role and was booked in the second half so will miss the final. Stefan Johansen created a couple of openings early on, but Ball was solid and kept the play moving. Looked comfortable when he switched to centre-back after Kiernan was injured.\nJason Holt (midfielder) 7\nNice and bright in possession throughout, and was always looking to link up with the forwards in the final third. Also didn't neglect his defensive duties. His performance was like his season: consistent.\nDean Shiels (forward) 7\nWas asked to play in a position that is not his strongest, wide on the right. Tracked back and performed diligently, while contributing to Rangers' good possession in the first half.\nKenny Miller (forward) 7\nEarly on, his intelligent run beyond Charlie Mulgrew delivered a chance and Craig Gordon had to save well. That's typical Miller, he sniffs out a chance and is always on the move. Took his goal well, tucking it away as he has done all his career. Typically sharp and hard working.\nBarrie McKay (forward) 9\nEven prior to the goal, he was Rangers' best player. Early on, he and Wallace combined well down the left, as Rangers took the game to Celtic. Has quick feet and glides past players. Gave Mikael Lustig a hard game. Always looked after the ball and scored an outstanding goal.\nNicky Law (midfielder) 6\nIt's always difficult to come into a game like this as a substitute. He was also asked to play in an unfamiliar position wide on the right. Will be disappointed to have let Kieran Tierney in to cross for Celtic's equaliser but he atoned in the shootout, with a cool penalty.\nGedion Zelalam (midfielder) 6\nFilled in when Ball had to move into defence and tried to keep play moving. Showed composure in the shootout to score a pressure penalty.\nNicky Clark (forward) 6\nWorked hard and showed good energy when he replaced Miller. Stepped up during the shootout but saw his effort saved\nCraig Gordon (goalkeeper) 7\nDid everything he was asked to do during the game. He didn't have any chance with either of the Rangers goals, but gave Celtic hope in the shootout when he saved Clark's penalty.\nMikael Lustig (defender) 6\nThe Sweden international had a hard time against Barrie McKay, particularly in the first half. He also didn't link up well with Patrick Roberts in front of him, and McKay and Wallace were able to get in a few times.\nDedryck Boyata (defender) 5\nOnly played for 23 minutes before leaving the field with an injury. Still made a couple of mistakes in that time, being caught in possession and having to commit a foul to halt a Rangers attack.\nCharlie Mulgrew (defender) 6\nHe was steady throughout the game at centre-back, and showed his experience. Didn't do anything wrong, and was fine in possession. Stepped up to take a penalty in the shootout.\nKieran Tierney (defender) 8\nClearly Celtic's best player. At times he was up against two Rangers players, but still able to handle both of them very well. Worked up and down the pitch, showed good defensive instincts and still had the legs and the wherewithal to create the equaliser late on in extra time with a great cross for Tom Rogic.\nScott Brown (midfielder) 7\nAnother steady performer for Celtic. At the start of the second half, when Celtic needed to up the tempo, he pushed further forward and helped to haul his side back into the game. He did what was asked of him.\nNir Bitton (midfielder) 6\nIn extra time he was signalling that he had a hamstring injury and needed to come off. But he stayed on the pitch, kept playing on and then stepped up to take a spot-kick. For all his ability, though, he was still too quiet at times.\nGary Mackay-Steven (forward) 5\nCouldn't really get into the game. Celtic did not use him that much, but in that case he then has to go looking for the ball, and demand to receive it. The game passed him by.\nStefan Johansen (midfielder) 5\nDidn't deliver enough on the day. With his talent, he should have been more influential, but that's been the story of this season for the Norwegian international.\nPatrick Roberts (forward) 6\nShould have equalised in the first half when faced with an open goal and had another scoring opportunity in the second half on his right foot, so missed big chances. Great delivery for the corner kick that Erik Sviatchenko scored from, but he tired late on.\nLeigh Griffiths (forward) 6\nNot one of his better games, looked jaded and could have worked the Rangers centre-backs more. He didn't get the right supply, but still managed to hit the post and then the bar late on with a magnificent free-kick which could have won the game.\nErik Sviatchenko (defender) 7\nScored a powerful header and had two more on target. Did OK defensively and shored Celtic up; his partnership alongside Mulgrew looked stronger.\nCallum McGregor (midfielder) 6\nWas busy when he came on, without influencing the outcome of the game. Also missed one of the spot kicks.\nTom Rogic (midfielder) 7\nScored a great goal and made things happen when he came on.

No-one else in the government had dared say a word.\nThe frequency and scale of the attacks carried out by Boko Haram have forced the president to take action and to silence some of his critics who accuse him of being out of touch and slow to react.\nSome analysts have suggested that if left to fester there is little to stop Boko Haram from setting up its own Islamic institutions in the extreme north-east.\nWill more boots on the ground improve the situation? Much will depend on how the troops behave. Analysts argue that the military has already lost the battle for hearts and minds and residents feel trapped between the two sides of this murky conflict.\nCan Nigeria quell Boko Haram?\nHowever, the group did bomb Nigeria's capital Abuja in 2011 and 2012.\nThe militants have forged closer links with al-Qaeda-linked militants in the Sahara region and have access to increasingly sophisticated weaponry. They are believed to move back and forth across frontiers, particularly the Cameroon border, say analysts.\nNigeria, a multi-ethnic nation of more than 160 million people, is also affected by conflicts over land, religion and oil.\nWednesday's Ministry of Defence statement said the army, police and other security agencies had begun operations to \"rid the nation's border territories of terrorist bases and activities\".\nThe declared aim that it will assert the nation's territorial integrity comes a day after the president said the state no longer controlled the entire territory of Nigeria, a somewhat embarrassing admission, says the BBC's Will Ross in Lagos.\nThe operation will focus on enhancing security of governmental structures after the president said attacks on government buildings and killings of officials and other civilians amounted to a declaration of war.\nBorno, Adamawa, and Yobe are three of the poorest states, far removed from the southern oilfields that feed government coffers.\n\"We've had a lot of problems [of] border crime, and criss-crossing of the border by the insurgents, and there's also evidence that some of the insurgents really are non-Nigerians,\" presidential spokesman Doyin Okupe told the BBC.\nFrom preachers to slave raiders\n\"As long as the terrorists can go in and out unchallenged, then we're in big trouble.\"\nResidents and reporters in the north-east said there had already been an influx of extra troops and military hardware.\n\"I have never seen soldiers on the move quite like this before,\" said Ahmed Mari, who lives in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state.\n\"A lot of fighting equipment has been deployed to Maiduguri,\" Hajja Maimuna, whose house is close to Maiduguri's Air Force base, told Nigeria's Daily Trust website.\n\"We are really terrified...

In most cases, IHT will be charged at 20% on money or property when it goes into the trust, if it exceeds the IHT allowance.\nIf the parent dies within seven years, an additional 20% is charged, to equal the 40% non-trust rate.\nIn addition, assets within a trust are usually re-assessed every ten years, to take account of changing property valuations, for example.\nUnder the existing rules, you can pass on money, property or possessions without paying any tax, as long as you survive for seven years after giving it to the recipient.\nIf you die within the seven year period, and you gift more than the allowance, a taper system exists. If you die six years after making the gift, for example, you will only pay 8% IHT. See table below.\nIn addition you can give up to £250 a year to as many people as you like without paying tax.\nUsually it is the estate which is liable for IHT. However if you are the recipient of a gift, and the giver has died within 7 years, and has already given away more than £325,000, you could be liable to pay IHT yourself.\nMore details on gifts\nAnyone can give away up to £3,000 a year, and pay no tax. This is known as the annual exemption. If unused, this allowance can be carried over to the following year, up to a maximum of £6,000.\nIn addition, if you can show that the gift was funded out of income - as opposed to savings - you will not pay IHT. But you may have to prove that the living standards of the deceased person were not reduced as a result.\nThe rules around wedding - or civil partnership - gifts are different again.

{"document": "A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization said agriculture accounted for about a fifth of emissions, which it said needed to be reduced.\nThe State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report said \"business as usual\" would leave millions at risk from hunger.\nLast year, nations adopted a UN goal of ending hunger by 2030.\n\"The climate is changing, so agriculture must change too,\" explained Rob Voss, director of FAO's Agricultural Development Economics division.\n\"We are saying that because agriculture is already very affected by the impacts of climate change, particularly the countries in the tropical zones.\n\"Also, agriculture is contributing itself to about one fifth of the global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,\" Mr Voss, who headed the team that produced the FAO State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report, added.\n\"If we continue along the present pathways then we will not be able to [deliver] food security around the world and we will not be able to stabilise the climate.\"\nAs a result, he told BBC News, there was a need for \"major changes\" to take place in the sector.\n\"One of the challenges is agriculture itself. As soon as we shovel the ground then we are already releasing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, as it is so dependent on water and quality of land, any impact from the change in climate has a direct impact.\"\nTherefore, he said, the challenge was bearing these changes in mind and looking at ways to shift to a more sustainable footing.\n\"A lot of the technologies that are available that allow us to do things differently do face a number of hurdles, especially when it comes to smallholder farmers in developing countries.'\nThese include the cost of changing the way farmers produce their food; knowledge of shifting to the novel ways of farming; urbanisation; access to water.\nIn terms of making the change to deliver a robust global food system, Mr Voss said the report highlighted four steps that could be taken:\n\"First, put in the steps that would help farmers switch to more sustainable practices, such as more efficient use of fertilizers and using heat tolerant and drought resistant crop varieties.\"\nHe added that management systems, such as agroforestry - which places forestry cultivation around farmlands, would also be beneficial as it helps farmers build in great resilience against the impacts of climate change.\n\"Secondly, we need to work harder to increase the capacity of soils and forestry to sequestrate carbon. Deforestation and changes to land-use is one of the major sources of emissions from the sector.\n\"A third area where we can immediately start work on is to reduce food losses and waste. We estimate that about one third of the food we produce gets lost in the post-harvest process or gets wasted at the consumer end.\n\"The fourth area, which is more challenging, is to try and do something about people's diets. What we have been seeing around the world is a clear shift towards increasing demands for food products that put a lot more pressure on natural resources.\"\nThe report observed: \"Rebalancing diets towards less animal-sourced foods would make an important contribution in this direction, with probable co-benefits for human health.\"\nFAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva said that the coming twelve months should be about \"putting commitments into action\", referring to the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goal of delivering \"zero hunger\" by 2030.\nHe also observed that agriculture was set to be one of the main topics for discussion at the forthcoming UN climate summit in Morocco in November.\n\"Climate change threatens all dimensions of food security,\" Mr Graziano da Silva warned.\n\"It will expose both urban and rural poor to higher and more volatile food prices.

{"document": "In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue.\nThe ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy.\nRepublicans have vowed to continue fighting the law.\n\"We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,\" Mr Obama said.\nThe case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court.\nUnlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens.\nThe enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so.\nIn 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it.\nIn that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law.\n\"Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday.\nHad the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable.\nThe stakes could not have been higher.\nPeople's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake.\nWell a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3.\nI bet \"No-drama Obama\" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is.\nObama defies lame-duck expectations\nDemonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning.\nReading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted \"If you're covered and you know it clap your hands.\"\n\"This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,\" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. \"The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land\".\n\"Today is a good day for healthcare in America,\" said activist Benton Strong. \"I hope this is the end of the line.\"\nDemonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence.\nJustice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others.\n\"We should start calling this law Scotuscare\" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. \"Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard of.\"\nCongressional Republicans have voted more than 50 times to undo the law.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner said that they will continue their \"efforts to repeal the law and replace it with patient-centred solutions that meet the needs of seniors, small business owners, and middle-class families\".\nFollowing the enactment of the ACA in 2010, states were given the option of establishing their own healthcare exchanges - online marketplaces for citizens to buy health coverage.\nCitizens in states that refused to establish exchanges could shop for coverage on a federal exchange.\nIn the court, opponents argued that a phrase included in the law, \"established by the state,\" meant the federal government could only provide subsidies to people in states that set up their own exchanges.\nHowever, most Americans receiving subsidies purchase healthcare through the federal exchange, after many states decided not to set up their own marketplaces. Only 13 states and Washington DC have set up their own exchanges.\nThe Obama administration argued that was a too-narrow reading of the law, which spans nearly 1,000 pages, and the rest of the legislation makes clear subsidies are intended for those who meet income requirements, regardless of which exchange insurance was purchased from.\nSource: Reuters\nThe upholding of the law cements President Obama's biggest legislative victory.

{"document": "So, it's no small achievement that Star Citizen's creator says he has raised more than $108m (Â£75m) to develop the title via online crowdfunding campaigns.\nIn fact, it makes the sci-fi space simulator the biggest crowdfunded project of all time.\nNot bad considering its creator, Chris Roberts, had originally hoped to raise about a tenth of the amount.\nThat would have funded a much smaller game than Star Citizen has evolved into, Roberts told the BBC.\n\"I never thought we would raise the money we have, I was going to start more contained and over time its sort of filled out,\" he said.\nBut with the title running years behind its originally announced schedule, he has still to prove he can meet the backers' expectations.\nRoberts is famous among video game fans for the popular 1990's spaceship combat Wing Commander series.\nThe popularity of these games built Roberts a huge fan base, which dug into its own pockets to fund his new PC game.\nRoberts' development company is called Cloud Imperium. It operates four studios spread across three different countries (the US, UK and Germany), all working to realise Star Citizen's grand vision.\nIt's what's known as a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game, which allows the player to pilot space ships, big and small, and even become part of the crew on huge vessels.\nThe universe is planned to be a huge explorable sandbox. Players should be able to engage in first-person combat, spaceship racing, visiting and exploring space stations and planets.\nIt is a persistent universe of huge ambition - so ambitious it's taking much longer to develop than originally anticipated.\nThe game was first announced back in 2012, with a release planned for 2014.\nBut at present only small taster portions of the game are available to play.\nInevitably some backers and internet observers have taken to forums and blogs to vent their anger at the delays.\n\"People who make games are optimists,\" Roberts admits.\n\"If you are building a two-bedroom house and suddenly change to building a castle it's going to be a different timeline.\"\nBut he also thinks this game is far from unique when it comes to delays.\n\"In the games business, games get cancelled all the time, games get pushed back and by the time you hear about the game it's probably been in development for years.\n\"Things always took longer than anyone thought.\"\nHe concedes that \"there are always going to be some people that say, you told me it was going to be two years, I want it to be this big , I want it in two years.\"\n\"That isn't necessarily possible,\" he adds.\n\"Most of our customers aren't like that. They say: 'Take the time you need. If you need 10 years for a really great space game don't rush it out and make a bad one.'\"\nWith the development studios spread out across the US and Europe, Roberts is often travelling between them all, checking the progress of the individual teams.\nBBC Click visited the Los Angeles studio in California and the Wilmslow studio in the UK.\nThe atmosphere inside the studios was almost identical: dozens of artists and designers working on spaceship designs and character animations as well as painstakingly sifting though lines of code in search of bugs.\nThere was a sense of calm, but the size and complexity of the project is mind boggling to the outside observer.\nThere are almost 300 people working on this game and they are taking advantage of their different time zones.\nThe studio head in Los Angeles said that when a bug is found by his team, they can work on the problem and then, at the end of their day, hand it over to workers in the UK to crack, and vice-versa with bugs found at any of the other studios.\nThey call this \"follow the sun\" development. It means that work on Star Citizen is pretty much a 24-hour operation.\nAs well as the persistent universe there will also be a single player story-driven game called Squadron 42.\nIt sounds very much like Roberts is working in familiar Wing Commander territory here. In Squadron 42 the player assumes the role of a rookie pilot, embroiled in a war with a vicious alien species.\nWhile the set-up is a little on the familiar side Roberts has assembled a star-studded cast for the game including Gary Oldman, Mark Strong and Gillian Anderson.\nWhile the larger universe is still in development, Roberts says he aims to release Squadron 42 by the end of this year.\nSo, it looks like we are going to have to wait a little bit longer to play the full Star Citizen experience.", "summary": "Few video games have a budget as big.", "id": "35555086"}

{"document": "Dear Alison\nI am compelled to write and seek review of an historic case of rape. Unusually, and contrary to current practice and the ACPO/CPS Guidance on the Investigation and Prosecution of Rape Cases, the investigation into the serious allegations in this case was dropped before the suspect was interviewed.\nThe elements of lack of freedom and capacity to consent - which may even have triggered the \"no consent\" legal presumption - make the decision highly irregular. This is shocking in itself. It further troubles me that the senior police officer who dropped the case revealed to the victim he apparently took a series of worthless stereotypes and other irrelevant points into consideration. He did this after apparently consulting with an unnamed CPS official. Most of these stereotypes have been blown out of the water in recent months. Or so I thought.\nThere has been a sea change in the climate surrounding rape, historic cases in particular. Why is it that the tide has not reached this case? I am driven to the unpalatable conclusion that the identity of the alleged perpetrator - Leon Brittan - may in some way have influenced treatment of the case.  I hope I am wrong. But in my view the case demands your personal attention and an immediate review by the CPS Area Head of Sexual Offences.\nAs you know, I have been working with the Metropolitan police on a number of cases involving sexual crimes over the last 18 months. I have been the recipient of a considerable amount of information from victims directly, much of which I have passed on to the police. You will know that some of this information has already led to arrests. I anticipate that, under your leadership, more work will follow.\nI enclose a contemporaneous note written by victim _________ of a rather blunt conversation she had with DCI Settle concerning his decision to drop the case. I invite you to note, in particular, that he told the victim - who had been locked in a flat and tried to escape from the bathroom window:\n\"There is no evidence he asked you for sex, forced you to have sex, or asked you to take off your clothes, which you did voluntarily\"\nThis was apparently considered to be a fatal deficiency. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the victim has not has this confirmed in writing as promised.\nI asked _______ to share her thoughts after her experience of reporting a crime. These are her words:\n\"My feelings are that I have been brutally misled having been encouraged by the DPP statements to come forward with my historical case following the Savile affair. All the public pronouncements after Savile suggested that these investigations would be treated sensitively, non-judgmentally and in a victim-centric way. I have been interviewed twice in long, harrowing video sessions first by ______ Police, then MPS [Metropolitan Police Service]. I have been encouraged by the MPS to believe that my evidence is both credible and corroborated. I have repeatedly had to relive the most harrowing night of my life, long pushed to the back of my mind. Then, when I had the temerity to question a police decision I have been turned on by a senior police officer, apparently with the support of the CPS. I have been implicitly accused of making an allegation against someone because 'it is all about who he is'. I have been implicitly accused of being a slut because I sat on a bed. These are attitudes that women of my generation associate with the police and prosecution authorities of the sixties and seventies, not an enlightened and publicly accountable twenty- first century service. It was these attitudes that made me think I would get nowhere if I proceeded with the case when the rape happened. It seems nothing has changed\". I have found myself appalled at the conduct of this investigation. I would like to believe that it is not typical of the CPS and Metropolitan police as a whole. However the case raises some very serious questions which are likely to remain unanswered without your attention.\nIn the light of this, please could you confirm to me that:\nEveryone is complicit in the failures of the past. But we have an opportunity now to put matters right. Any attempt to perpetuate a CPS in which a victim's acquiescence in or inability to escape rape is a barrier to prosecution would fail, with grievous consequences, and would be wrong. There is a strong public interest in getting this right.\nI have every confidence that your leadership, and personal intervention in this case, will take the CPS in an altogether better direction.", "summary": "Below is the full letter that deputy Labour leader Tom Watson sent to the director public prosecutions Alison Saunders in April 2014 urging her to look again at the Lord Brittan allegations.", "id": "34509582"}

{"document": "As Iraq lurches deeper into turmoil and disintegration, Kurdish leaders in the already autonomous north are threatening to break away and declare outright independence.\nAnd the militants of the self-styled Islamic State (IS), bulldozing the border between Iraq and Syria in June 2014, declared their intention to eradicate all the region's frontiers and lay Sykes-Picot to rest forever.\nWhatever the fate of IS, the future as unitary states of both Syria and Iraq - central to the Sykes-Picot project - is up in the air.\nIn fact, virtually none of the Middle East's present-day frontiers were actually delineated in the document concluded on 16 May 1916 by British and French diplomats Mark Sykes and Francois Georges-Picot.\nThe Iraq-Syria border post histrionically erased by IS was probably several hundred kilometres from the famous \"line in the sand\" drawn by Sykes and Picot, which ran almost directly from the Persian border in the north-east, down between Mosul and Kirkuk and across the desert towards the Mediterranean, veering northwards to loop around the top end of Palestine.\nThe region's current borders emerged from a long and complex process of treaties, conferences, deals and conflicts that followed the break-up of the Ottoman Empire and the end of World War One.\nBut the spirit of Sykes-Picot, dominated by the interests and ruthless ambitions of the two main competing colonial powers, prevailed during that process and through the coming decades, to the Suez crisis of 1956 and even beyond.\nBecause it inaugurated that era, and epitomised the concept of clandestine colonial carve-ups, Sykes-Picot has become the label for the whole era in which outside powers imposed their will, drew borders and installed client local leaderships, playing divide-and-rule with the \"natives\", and beggar-my-neighbour with their colonial rivals.\nThe resulting order inherited by the Middle East of the day sees a variety of states whose borders were generally drawn with little regard for ethnic, tribal, religious or linguistic considerations.\nOften a patchwork of minorities, there is a natural tendency for such countries to fall apart unless held together by the iron grip of a strongman or a powerful central government.\nThe irony is that the two most potent forces explicitly assailing the Sykes-Picot legacy are at each other's throats: the militants of IS, and the Kurds in the north of both Iraq and Syria.\nIn both countries, the Kurds have proven the Western coalition's most effective allies in combating IS, although the two sides share a determination to redraw the map.\n\"It's not just me that's saying it, the fact is that Sykes-Picot has failed, it's over,\" said the president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan Region, Massoud Barzani, in a BBC interview.\n\"There has to be a new formula for the region. I'm very optimistic that within this new formula, the Kurds will achieve their historic demand and right [to independence]\".\n\"We have passed through bitter experiences since the formation of the Iraqi state after World War One. We tried to preserve the unity of Iraq, but we are not responsible for its fragmentation - it's the others who broke it up.\n\"We don't want to be part of the chaos and problems which surround Iraq from all sides.\"\nPresident Barzani said the drive for independence was very serious, and that preparations were going ahead \"full steam\".\nHe said the first step should be \"serious negotiations\" with the central government in Baghdad to reach an understanding and a solution, towards what Kurdish leaders are optimistically calling an \"amicable separation\".\nIf that did not produce results, he said, the Kurds should go ahead unilaterally with a referendum on independence.\n\"It's a necessary step, because all the previous attempts and experiments failed. If current conditions aren't helpful for independence, there are no circumstances which favour not demanding this right.\"\nIraq's Kurds are landlocked and surrounded by neighbours - Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq itself - which have traditionally quashed Kurdish aspirations.\nUnder threat from IS, they are more dependent than ever on Western powers which are also strongly counselling them to stick with Iraq.\nBut whether or not the Iraqi Kurds achieve full formal independence in the near future, they have already established an entity with borders, a flag, international airports, a parliament and government, and its own security forces - everything except a passport and their own currency.\nTo that extent, they have already redrawn the map. And next door in northern Syria, their fellow Kurds are essentially doing the same, controlling and running large swathes of land along the Turkish border under the title of \"self-administration\".\nAs for IS, its territorial gains have already peaked. But the chaos in both Iraq and Syria that allowed it to take root have yet to run their course - the alienation of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority (and the Kurds), and Syria's fragmentation in a vicious sectarian civil war.\nThe unspoken struggle is over whether formulas can be found for different communities to live together within the borders bequeathed by 20th Century history, or whether new frontiers will have to be drawn to accommodate those peoples - however that concept is defined.\n\"Sykes-Picot is finished, that's for sure, but everything is now up in the air, and it will be a long time before it becomes clear what the result will be,\" said the veteran Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt.\nThe Sykes-Picot agreement conflicted directly with pledges of freedom given by the British to the Arabs in exchange for their support against the collapsing Ottomans.\nIt also collided with the vision of the US President Woodrow Wilson, who preached self-determination for the peoples subjugated by the Ottoman Empire.\nHis foreign policy adviser Edward House was later informed of the agreement by UK Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, who 18 months on was to put his name to a declaration which was to have an even more fateful impact on the region.\nHouse wrote: \"It is all bad and I told Balfour so. They are making it a breeding place for future war.\"", "summary": "Reaching its centenary amidst a general chorus of vilification around the region, the legacy of the secret Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916 has never looked more under assault.", "id": "36300224"}

As soon as he was elected Ben [Howlett] and myself helped compile a dossier and that dossier was given by Ben to Lord Feldman and Sayeeda Warsi.\"\nHe said that complaints had been made to the party about Mr Clarke's behaviour even before 2010 when Mr Clarke was removed from the party's list of approved candidates.\n\"The dossier is not the only thing,\" Mr Sullivan said. \"There were complaints about Mark Clarke in 2008.

Elliott Johnson had previously complained to CCHQ that he had been bullied by Mr Clarke, and named Mr Clarke in a letter left to his parents.\nMr Clarke has denied all allegations of inappropriate behaviour. He has told Newsnight he was not aware of any \"dossier\" mentioning him in 2010.\nOn Tuesday night Elliott's father Ray told Newsnight: \"If Lord Feldman and CCHQ were fully aware of allegations of bullying being made as long ago as five years and they didn't act upon it, then it just confirms my view that they really should have taken action against bullies in the first place and failed to do so.\"\n\"They failed to protect my son and they failed to protect many other young activists and they should stand up and take responsibility for it.\"\nFormer co-chairman Grant Shapps resigned last month as a development minister after it emerged that he had given Mr Clarke a formal role in CCHQ despite previous concerns about his behaviour.\nHowever both Number 10 and the party have been determined to protect Lord Feldman who has been a member of the prime minister's inner circle since they met at Oxford.\nIncreasingly, however, Lord Feldman has come under pressure, both over his account of when he first became aware of allegations of bullying, and over whether he reacted appropriately to a slew of complaints received in August of this year.\nLast week Newsnight revealed a former CCHQ worker submitted a memo to a senior party official in August claiming that Mr Clarke was \"sociopathic\" and \"dangerous\" and warning that there could be \"devastating\" consequences if he was not kept away from the party's youth wing.\nAsked whether he believed Lord Feldman should have done more in response to the memo, Mr Sullivan said: \"Yes I do, I think it was quite shocking that Mark Clarke was able to continue with his RoadTrip 2020 whilst this investigation was process.\"\nLord Feldman said on Tuesday night: \"I was wholly unaware of allegations of bullying and inappropriate sexual conduct by Mr Clarke prior to August 2015.

{"document": "The perception that in some areas police had lost control of the streets was the most important reason disorder spread, they said.\nThe Home Affairs Committee said insufficient numbers of officers were initially deployed and police training for public disorder was inadequate.\nThe Metropolitan Police said it had outlined what it was doing to improve.\nThe Policing Large Scale Disorder: Lessons from the disturbances of August 2011 report said flooding the streets with police was what ultimately quelled the disorder.\n\"If numbers could have been increased more rapidly, it is possible that some of the disturbances could have been avoided,\" it said.\n\"We regret this did not happen and, with the benefit of hindsight, we regard the operation to police the disorder in many towns and cities, and particularly in London as flawed.\"\nIt said the mutual aid system, under which police officers are transferred to forces in need, could have operated more quickly; it may have left areas which had loaned officers to other forces \"vulnerable\".\nThe report said anecdotal evidence from some of those convicted suggested the widespread disorder started when people saw police had \"lost control\" in Tottenham via television and social media. This echoes the findings of the independent Riots Communities and Victims Panel.\n\"Clearly a feeling existed that desirable consumer goods could be made available by looting. There was a substantial element of opportunistic criminality and copycat behaviour,\" the report said.\n\"The absence of a police presence or sight of police officers apparently standing by and allowing criminal behaviour to take place was distressing for those whose homes and businesses were being attacked,\" it added.\nCommittee chairman Keith Vaz MP said: \"Individual police officers acted with great bravery, and we commend them for their actions. However, in London and other areas, in contrast with the effectiveness of police responses in some towns and cities, there was a failure of police tactics.\n\"This situation might have been avoided had police appreciated the magnitude of the task.\n\"We urgently require a rapid improvement in police training to deal with public disorder. We urge the police to act more quickly in future and to review the arrangements for loaning officers from one force to another in this type of scenario.\"\nHe said that, for those who lost their homes and businesses, \"the state effectively ceased to exist - sometimes for hours at a time\".\nMr Vaz told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the committee felt that there should have been better communication between the police and the local business community to ensure that people knew what was happening and how best to protect their livelihoods.\n\"Those areas where the chief constables had decided to take pre-emptive action and get police officers on the streets quickly were able to contain this violence much more effectively,\" he added.\nThe MPs say had more officers been deployed different tactics could have been used. The Met Police is training more police to use baton rounds and is considering buying three water cannon.\nMr Vaz said the committee did not feel water cannon would have helped police in the riots and may have caused \"even greater disorders\".\nRiots broke out in Tottenham, north London, on 6 August, two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan. Unrest spread across London and to other cities, including Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol over the following days.\nBut the committee's report said the specific causes behind the riots were still unknown.\nThe report criticised the Met Police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission over failures in communication with Mr Duggan's family, which it said made a potentially tense situation worse.\nThe committee also concluded it would be unhelpful to switch off social media during times of disorder, following claims rioters used it to organise themselves.\n\"People who made an active decision to join in the disorder could equally well have heard about it on the television as on social media,\" the report said.\nThe MPs say the government needs to urgently clarify whether the police authorities will be able to recover the Â£89.827m it cost to police the riots. It says the riots were an exceptional series of events at a time the authorities were being asked to make savings.\nThey also call on the government to speed up the process of reimbursing people under the Riot Damages Act.\nThe Met Police said it had already recognised and publicised some of its findings on the issues identified and what it was doing to improve.\nA spokesman said: \"This includes acknowledging that we didn't have enough officers available quickly enough to respond to the initial disorder or its subsequent unprecedented escalation. As a result we have changed our mobilisation plans.\"\nHe added that the force was reviewing how it engaged with local communities and was working with Acpo and the IPCC to ensure communication was more effective in future investigations.\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers said the report had identified issues it believed was critical to get right within current policing reforms.\n\"This includes the capacity and ability to move sufficient numbers of police officers around the country when required to protect the public from national threats,\" a spokesman said.\n\"We will continue to look at all the various reports into the disorder to examine how the police service can best respond in future to the kind of exceptional criminality seen in August.\"", "summary": "The policing operation to tackle the summer riots across England was flawed, a report from MPs has concluded.", "id": "16237077"}

They said councils spent Â£4.67 billion between them last year - down Â£140m on the previous year.\nThe government said the Conservatives' figures were wrong as some of the numbers quoted were not directly comparable.\nScottish Conservative education spokeswoman Mary Scanlon said: \"At a time when the schools budget in England has been protected, these new figures reveal another cut in funding for schools in Scotland.\n\"The cost of this is clear. In England the number of full-time teachers has increased by more than 3,000 between 2010 and 2013.\n\"But in Scotland, over the same period, the numbers have fallen by around 1,000.\n\"This is the price schools are paying for the SNP's failure to take any responsibility for our schools system and undertake the reforms that are necessary to turn it around.\n\"It's not good enough for them to blame others - the cuts to spending and the fall in literacy and numeracy standards is happening on the SNP's watch.\"\nBut the Scottish government insisted the Conservatives' use of figures is wrong.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"This comparison is completely inaccurate and misleading, as it compares net expenditure in 2014/15 with gross expenditure for past years. Provisional outturn was higher in 2014-15 than it was in 2013-14.\n\"We also know councils are planning to spend 3.3% more on the delivery of education in 2015-16 - the largest increase in six years.\n\"We know spending per pupil is significantly higher in Scotland than England.\n\"Despite Westminster austerity, we remain wholly committed to mitigating the effects of welfare cuts and ensuring our education system is resourced to continue to meet the needs of children, parents, schools and communities.\"\nThe largest teaching union, the EIS, said education budgets had been under pressure, but had little sympathy for the Conservatives' claims.\nGeneral secretary Larry Flanagan said: \"The damaging age of austerity imposed by the UK government has had a significant detrimental impact on the funding available to public services in Scotland.\n\"Education has not been immune from the downward pressure on Scottish government and local authority budgets, and this had led to serious challenges in our schools owing to declining teacher numbers, lack of school resources and rising class sizes.\n\"The attempt by the Tory party, however, to exploit the impact of an austerity programme which they are imposing seems somewhat hypocritical.\n\"Scottish education needs additional resources but it does not need the type of retrograde policies pursued so disastrously in England by the likes of Michael Gove.\"\nEach council decides for itself just how much to spend on education, although some important costs like teachers' pay are set nationally.\nHowever, councils receive the overwhelming bulk of their money from the Scottish government.\nEducation is the biggest service councils provide, and the biggest challenge facing councils just now is money.\nTypically about 80% of each council's budget comes from the Scottish government. Council tax, which makes up most of the rest, has been frozen since 2007.\nThe latest council funding agreement obliged councils to maintain teacher numbers or risk losing money.\nSome councils objected to this - arguing this amounted to micro-management in their affairs, and claiming there was more to raising attainment in schools than simply maintaining teacher numbers.\nWhile the government strongly disputes the Conservatives' use of figures, there is little doubt that some council education budgets are under scrutiny as councils continue to look for savings.\nIn recent months four councils looked at reducing the length of the primary school week, while services such as school libraries have also been under the spotlight.\nThe Scottish government - which currently receives all its money from Westminster - argues it has been trying to do its best for councils in the face of tight funding settlements and believes the council tax freeze has been a help to family budgets.\nHowever, critics point out that councils are left with little practical control of the size of their overall budgets.", "summary": "A row has broken out over claims councils have slashed their education budgets.", "id": "32978032"}

{"document": "The assessments should indicate whether chemical weapons were used and if so the agent involved.\nThe work could also reveal whether the weapons systems were improvised or designed for military use.\nThe analysis being carried out by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons under the auspices of the United Nations.\nNeither the UN nor the OPCW will comment on details of the investigation. But BBC News has spoken to a former senior employee of the OPCW, who has given his assessment of the likely details and timetable of the testing process.\nDr Ralf Trapp said that samples from Syria gathered by inspectors had arrived at the OPCW central laboratory on Saturday and would be arriving at \"designated laboratories\" across the world around now for analysis. The results will form part of a report by the OPCW due to be published by the UN on the alleged attack. He told BBC News that the report would take between seven to 10 days to complete at the earliest.\nThe report should contain strong scientific evidence to help establish whether chemical weapons were involved in the alleged attack last in the agricultural belt Ghouta around the Syrian capital Damascus. It could also possibly indicate the type of delivery systems to have been used, according to Dr Trapp.\n\"There may be details of the concentrations of the agent used and whether these weapons were improvised or designed for a military context,\" he said.\nThe purpose of the UN/OPCW report is to establish the facts of what happened rather than find the culprit. However, according to Dr Trapp, these facts should give an indication of the source. It will also help answer why, in his opinion, many of the victims did not display the typical symptoms of sarin exposure, such as the narrowing of pupils (known as pinball eyes) and shaking, in video clips uploaded shortly after the alleged attack.\n\"I'm pretty sure it was a chemical attack, but I'm not 100% sure it was sarin, or sarin of bad quality, another agent, or a mixture of things. All these things make sense in the context of what we have seen (in the videos),\" he explained.\nLast week OPCW and UN investigators were gathering soil, blood, urine and hair from the alleged victims of the attack and tissue samples from corpses. They have also been wiping possible chemical residues from the inside of shell fragments.\nThere had been concern that few, if any, traces of nerve agent would be detected following the two days it took for UN inspectors to arrive at the site of the alleged attack. But according to Dr Trapp, evidence of these agents would remain for many weeks.\nThe samples have been tagged, photographed and transported to OPCW's central laboratory in sealed containers. The testing procedures involve numerous checks and cross checks to ensure that there is no mix up in the samples and the results are accurate.\nEach sample is sent to three separate laboratories that the organisation has inspected and deemed competent to carry out the testing on its behalf. If there are many samples to analyse, they are sent to other laboratories. Individual labs conduct their own independent tests of the material.\nFor each sample from the site of the alleged attack, a given laboratory receives two dummy samples; one containing no nerve agent and another containing a specified amount of a nerve agent or its breakdown product. The lab is not told which sample is which, enabling the OPCW to ensure that each lab does its job properly.\nIn addition, a lab has to test each sample using two completely different methods - and then, as a triple check to verify the accuracy of the instruments they are using, manufacture the agent it thinks it has detected and run the test again to see if they obtain the same result.\nThis painstaking process will take the scientists several days to complete, after which the lead investigator will have to write up a report which is then sent back to the OPCW.\nThese results are combined with interviews, assessments of medical reports by inspectors.\nThe time all this will take depends on the number of samples that have to be analysed and the number of labs involved in the testing.\nDr Trapp believes that mid to late next week will be the very earliest that the UN could receive the completed report although Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will be receiving regular updates in the interim.\nOne of the testing sites on the OPCW's list of \"designated laboratories\" is the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down in Wiltshire, which is internationally respected for its research capability in this area. The network of more than 20 laboratories also includes facilities in China, the US and France.\nThe laboratories undertaking the work will have been selected by the OPCW's director-general Mr Ahmet Uzumcu, no doubt in consultation with Mr Ban. The list of institutions has not been revealed but there is speculation that laboratories in countries on the UN's Security Council are not involved.\nFollow Pallab on Twitter", "summary": "Samples from the sites of alleged chemical attacks in Syria are arriving at laboratories for analysis.", "id": "23947149"}

{"document": "They were made 110 years ago by the Wall family who lived in New Southgate in North London.\nThere are 24 clear recordings on wax cylinders which were made using a phonograph machine between 1902 and 1917.\nMusic curators say the sound quality of the music recorded is outstanding.\nThe recordings were found at the former home of David Brown, Cromwell Wall's grandson, in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire and donated to St Neot's Museum. It was then discovered that the recordings were made in London.\nCromwell Wall's great-great grandchildren, Layla and Zac Jordan, from Sandy in Bedfordshire, heard the recordings for the first time when they visited the Museum of London.\nCromwell and Minnie Wall had nine children, eight of whom appear on the recordings. All the recordings are bursting with vibrancy and life, according to Julia Hoffbrand who is the curator at the Museum of London who helped restore the recordings.\n\"When I first heard the recordings the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" she said. \"It was fantastic. We had an idea of what was on the recordings because Cromwell had written very full descriptions on the cylinder boxes but it was really like a window opening into the past. It was like being in the same room as the family and their friends\".\nMany of the recordings were made at family gatherings over Christmas and New Year.\nCromwell Wall, who made the recordings, wheeled the phonograph along the streets in his children's pram in order to record the sound of Old Southgate Church bells pealing out New Year.\nSome of the later recordings were made during WWI when three of the sons, who feature in earlier recordings were away at war. One son, Oliver, died of pneumonia in a French hospital three weeks before peace was declared.\nThe recordings were restored this summer and many of the relatives heard them for the first time in October. It brought back some great memories for Oliver Wall, one of Cromwell's grandchildren.\n\"It was a wonderful atmosphere. I remember the occasions always at Christmas and we always had big parties and singing round the piano with grandpa playing and he used to take us marching upstairs and all over the big house they had.\"\nHis cousin Daphne reminisces how their grandfather used to dress up as Father Christmas.\n\"There was a great deal of excitement,\" she said. \"It was fun!\"\nIt is very unusual for recordings on wax phonograph cylinders to survive for so long. Phonographs were introduced for use in offices as dictating machines and so it is extremely rare for them to be used to record domestic sounds and occasions.\n\"We were thrilled,\" says Julia Hoffbrand. \"Phonographs and cylinders were expensive so you had to have a certain level of income to record and a level of skill and care to make recordings and to take care of the cylinders.\"\nThe cylinders themselves are similar to old fashioned vinyl records in that the phonograph would make indentations into the cylinder which could then be replayed.  Bill Lowry, digital collections manager at the Museum was among those who helped restore the cylinders.\n\"We tried to reduce any noise by cleaning the cylinder first with a fine brush that can get in between the groove and once we had the best playback from the cylinder we then digitally cleaned them up.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter", "summary": "Curators at the Museum of London have discovered what they believe to be the first ever recordings of a family Christmas.", "id": "20772246"}

{"document": "If the same rule applies to pop stars, then Lion Babe have their future guaranteed.\nFrontwoman Jillian Hervey cuts an imposing image with her cascading leonine locks; and the band's music is equally fierce.\nThey first came to attention in 2012 with Treat Me Like Fire, a slinky, shapeshifting song that hits the sweet spot between pop, jazz and R&B.\nIt brought Hervey and her co-writer Lucas Goodman to the attention of record labels and fellow musicians alike, and the past 18 months has seen the band work with the likes of Mark Ronson, Childish Gambino and Pharrell Williams, who produced their new single Wonder Woman.\nSpeaking to the BBC during a recent trip to London, the duo discussed growing up with famous parents and what it's like inside Pharrell's studio.\nHello! How are you?\nJillian: We're great, thank you! We're in the car between photo shoots.\nIs that as glamorous as it sounds?\nJillian: Yeah, why not? It's definitely a lot of fun. Good to have the photos for later on in life!\nDo you get to take the clothes home?\nLucas: No!\nJillian: I'm working on that. Actually, the shoes I have on right now were part of a shoot. I kept talking about them and eventually they worked it out so I got to take them home with me. Hopefully down the line we'll get some more freebies!\nDoes being a dancer help you in front of the camera?\nJillian: I definitely think I'm more aware of how to hold my body. But Lucas isn't a dancer and he's doing just fine.\nLucas: She's been showing me some moves. I'm learning.\nHow long have you been Lion Babe?\nJillian: It's been two years since we've been working as Lion Babe every day - but our friendship started six years ago.\nI met Lucas at a party where, just by chance, I heard his music. So I introduced myself and told him I liked it. We didn't really stayed connected, but I followed his MySpace. And then I ended up in New York for college. I had to do a piece for school with original music - and Lucas was the only producer I knew.\nWe did that and it went very well. A very easy collaboration. Eventually I mentioned I was interested in singing and he came over to my apartment. He was making beats up right on the spot and our first attempt at making a real song was actually Treat Me Like Fire, which was our first single.\nThat song got you a lot of attention. When did you realise it had taken on a life of its own?\nJillian: When we first got a response from the UK, that was definitely surprising.  It was maybe two weeks after the song came out, and we were like: \"Woah! How did people in the UK find this?\"\nThen we started getting emails from UK labels. It all happened very fast but we knew the door was open, so we wanted to take it seriously.\nGrowing up in a showbusiness family (Hervey's mother is actress and singer Vanessa Williams), was it always in the back of your mind that you'd pursue music?\nJillian: Actually, growing up, I didn't want to go into acting and singing because that was my mum's thing. It was too much pressure. But dancing gave me more confidence to try other things.\nTreat Me Life Fire sampled Eunice Collins, and your next single sampled Nina Simone. It's very brave to draw that comparison. I guess you're very confident in your voice?\nJillian: I wouldn't say that! That's the beauty of working with a great producer. If he had the guts to make the beat I had to have the guts to sing it.\nI knew I didn't want to sound like all these people on the radio, so having these unique, rich voices was a challenge. If Nina Simone's on the track, I'd better step my game up!\nYou practically disappeared for 18 months after Treat Me Like Fire. What was happening?\nLucas: We had to write more songs! A lot of people thought we were more established that we actually were. In the end we only had one song.\nWhat's it like working with Pharrell and Mark Ronson? Is there a danger they'll dilute what made you special in the first place?\nLucas: We're not really worried about watering anything down. In the end, the main thing is \"do we feel it or not?\" If we don't, we should just move on.\nBut as fans of music, the experience of working with these people is amazing. I learned so much in our session. Not so much from the things he said but from watching him work. All of that cycles in your head for the next week. It expands your mind.\nSo what's Pharrell like in the studio?\nLucas: We had two days with him in Miami. He's a really busy guy, so he was working on other things at the same time.\nWe'd go into the studio and get started. Then he'd come in and vibe out for a minute, and he'd make some parts right there and then - like a bass line or a little guitar riff. Then he'd be like, \"OK, I gotta go. I'll be back in a couple of hours\".\nSo we'd take the parts and start writing and re-arranging. Then he'd come back and we'd show him what we'd got. He'd be like, 'OK that's cool\" and maybe lay down another line on top.\nSince you've been in the UK, you've performed covers of Curtis Mayfield's Move On Up and Janis Joplin's Piece of my Heart. Is that the kind of music you're trying to emulate?\nJillian: Not necessarily. When it came to doing these sessions, we really wanted to think of an American artist who'd come over the UK with a raw funky flavour, and who was really embraced. So if it wasn't a Janis song, it would have been Jimi Hendrix.\nOur parents introduced us to funk and soul, so it's a natural place for us to go - but we also love The Strokes and Grace Jones and Lee Scratch Perry.\nOften the songs we reference when we're writing are completely different from the ones we end up making!\nWhat are you obsessing over at the moment?\nLucas: This guy called D.R.A.M. - he's got this song called Cha Cha, which has this great melody with this mariachi, almost cheesy, trumpet sound. It's so good.\nTrumpets seem to be back in fashion at the minute.\nJillian: I like it. I used to play trumpet so why not? My trumpet's actually red. Fun fact.\nIs that coming out on the tour?\nJillian: Not telling!\nWonder Woman is out now on Outsiders/Universal.

overcrowded conditions the youngest brother left behind.\nHe was five years below the legal age at which he could be sent overseas to fight.\n\"He was probably looking for proper clothes and decent meals,\" according to policeman turned local historian Michael Crick, who has followed Private Parr's paper trail.\nThe brown-haired, brown-eyed boy was working as a caddie at his local golf course when he signed up.\n\"He was looking for adventure and something to do with his life,\" great-niece Iris says.\nHis life - like more than 700,000 others from the British Isles after him - was cut short on continental Europe.\nBut unlike those whose bodies were never found and who have no headstone, Private Parr entered history as the first of his comrades to die fighting Germany.\nHe would miss the horrors of the trenches, poison gas and mechanised warfare - shot and killed shortly after his 17th birthday.\n\"He's almost an iconic symbol of that first contact of the British Army with that massive German juggernaut crashing through Belgium on its way into France,\" says military historian Jon Cooksey.\nThere are no known photographs of the 5ft 3in teenager from the north London suburbs, described by his superiors as \"clean, sober and intelligent\" but \"inclined to be insubordinate\".\nAfter joining his local regiment, the Middlesex, he became a reconnaissance cyclist, trained to ride ahead to retrieve information quickly for commanding officers.\nWhen war broke out he and 1,100 other men in his battalion were shipped from Southampton to Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France as the German army was advancing into Belgium.\nThe first major engagement of German and British troops in Europe came at the Battle of Mons on 23 August 1914 and there are conflicting reports of when exactly John went missing around this time.\nAs far as the military was concerned, he was still with his regiment almost half a year later.\n\"According to the records here, the man is still serving with his battalion,\" an official at the Infantry Records Office wrote on 27 January 1915.\nAmid the administrative chaos at the start of the war, John's worried mother seems to have known more than those in charge.\n\"I've not heard from him at all and the War Office can tell me nothing,\" she wrote to the official, underlining the word \"nothing\".\n\"I have heard from Berlin,\" she went on. \"The address is from a prisoner of war - one of my son's chums - to say that my son was shot down at Mons.\"\nAnd this is where the mystery of Pte Parr's death begins.\nIt has long been thought that he came across German cavalry after heading off on his bike on a reconnaissance mission from where his unit was based near Bettignies - a French village on the border with Belgium - before the August battle.\nAlmost 70 years later, the curator of Pte Parr's local regimental museum recalled L/Cpl W Beart, one of the soldier's fellow cyclists, saying that, on 21 August 1914, the men had caught a \"glimpse of Uhlans\" - a German regiment.\nL/Cpl W Beart made it back but the comrade he called \"Old Parr\" was never seen again.\nWas one of the Uhlan soldiers responsible for the death of \"Old Parr\"?\nThe shooting was apparently witnessed by an eight-year-old Belgian girl.\nAndy Robertshaw, a historian who traced the girl as an elderly woman, says she remembered Private Parr waving his comrade away when the two men were shot at.\n\"Parr was in a ditch, shooting down her road to the east to give his mate time to get back to base,\" he says.\nThe first British soldier died, the woman said, after a German soldier ran through her garden to shoot him.\nBut on that night, according to Jon Cooksey, there is no way the men could have encountered any enemy soldiers.\n\"Looking at all the documents,\" he says, \"it's more likely he was killed on the 23rd at the Battle of Mons.\"\nHe adds that John Parr's burial by the Germans in St Symphorien Cemetery, \"just three miles from where his battalion fought that day\", backs this up.\nGiven the battle claimed some 1,600 British casualties, this raises the prospect that Private Parr may not have been the first to fall.\nJon Cooksey has studied troop movements and war diaries on both sides.\nHe says if Pte Parr was killed on the date on his headstone, it must either have been by a trigger-happy Belgian \"terrified of the German hordes\", so-called friendly fire from a French cavalry patrol or, worse, from his own side.\n\"The point where he is supposed to have been killed couldn't by any stretch of the imagination have been correct,\" the author and broadcaster says.\nOn 21 August, according to the battalion war diary, John Parr's regiment was 11 miles south of the position it would take up to fight at Mons - German units did not cross the Mons-Conde Canal until the afternoon of 23 August.\nThere is no mention in any of the brigade or divisional diaries of any contact with the enemy, Jon Cooksey says.\nNor is there any record of contact with the British in the Germans diaries.\n\"And what a coup that would have been for that German soldier,\" he adds. \"No such record exists.\"\nAndy Robertshaw acknowledges it could actually have been a Belgian who unwittingly fired the shot that killed Pte Parr.\n\"If you're a Belgian, you've never seen a British soldier before,\" he explains.\nThe first contact the Germans and British report is on 22 August 1914, just after dawn, when cavalry patrols from the two sides meet.\nAnd this, according to Jon Cooksey, is still another two miles north of where Pte Parr is supposed to have been killed.\nBack in London, it is now January 1915 and a fraught Alice Parr has heard nothing from those running the war.\nShe received a letter from the captain of John's regiment.\n\"He informed [me] that my son Private John Parr has been missing from the regiment since August the 23rd 1914 and has not been heard of since,\" she wrote again to the records office.\n\"I should be very grateful for any information as to his whereabouts.\"\nThere is nothing to indicate when Alice or her family were finally told John Parr would not be coming home.\n\"They didn't get any closure at all,\" says ex-policeman turned local historian Michael Crick.\n\"And even when they did learn months later that he was killed, they were never able to find out the circumstances.\"\nOfficial records refer to the \"late\" Private Parr almost a year after his death, on 19 August 1915 but shed no light on what actually happened to him.\n\"In truth, the mystery is probably never going to be solved,\" Jon Cooksey says.", "summary": "A ceremony is being held at the WW1 grave of Private John Parr -

{"document": "The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000.\nThe aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe.\nIn particular, the project wants every school to have a connection.\nBuilding so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus.\nIt can take Europe’s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today’s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.\nThat means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.\nThe idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.\nThe boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.\n\"Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.\n\"Here, we’ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,\" he told BBC News.\nAirbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.\nThe most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the \"revolution\" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.\nThe first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.\nAnother batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.\nThe establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.\nMore than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.\nThere should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.\nOneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.\nEquity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a \"truly global company\" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.\n\"A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,\" said OneWeb CEO Eric Béranger.\n\"And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries.\"\nOne aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.\nThe fear is that space could eventually become unusable.\nA recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.\nBrian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.\n\"We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit.\"\nTime will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.\nAirbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment.\n\"Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,” said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "summary": "European aerospace giant Airbus and its partner, OneWeb, have begun the production of a satellite mega-constellation.", "id": "40422011"}

{"document": "Celebrations are taking place in the West Bank town where it is believed that Jesus was born.  However this year they are overshadowed by the latest Israeli-Palestinian violence that shows no signs of abating.\nMary Anastas runs a shop selling her husband's stone sculptures and feels a special affinity with her namesake, the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus.\nShe is a mother of three children herself and worries about their safety in these tense times. The two eldest are studying at Birzeit University, north of Ramallah, but come home at weekends.\nYoung Palestinians regularly join protests that result in confrontations with Israeli soldiers.  There are flashpoints across the West Bank including on the edge of Ramallah and in Bethlehem.\nLike many Palestinian Christians, Mary thinks the holiday spirit is dampened this year and that festivities will be relatively low-key.\nShepherds watching their flocks by night are believed by Christians to have been the first to hear about Jesus' birth.  Tradition has it that they were told the news by an angel in the Shepherds' Field in Beit Sahur, next to Bethlehem.\nNowadays, Kamal Nabaheen keeps sheep and goats in this area.  He is Muslim, but prizes his connection to the Biblical shepherds.\nRecently shepherding has become much more difficult because of a lack of open land. Jewish settlements are expanding nearby. They are seen as illegal under international law, but Israel disagrees.\nIsrael has also built part of its separation barrier here.  It says this is needed for security, but Palestinians see it as a land grab.\nAccording to the Bible, there was no room at the inn in Bethlehem for Mary and Joseph.  With no bed available, baby Jesus was laid in a manger.\nIn modern times, hotels are usually full on Christmas Eve.  Arab-Israelis as well as foreign visitors come to join the festivities as processions of church leaders arrive from Jerusalem.\nFadi Kattan runs a new boutique guesthouse, Hosh al-Syrian, in the Old City of Bethlehem.  He says that since the recent troubles, people have cancelled their hotel bookings for next year.\nThere are also other underlying challenges for local tourism.  It tends to be seasonal with Christian pilgrims coming at Easter and Christmas, but more and more visitors are staying elsewhere and coming to Bethlehem as a day trip on a Holy Land tour.  The main attraction is the Church of the Nativity, built on the spot where it is believed Jesus was born.\nThe Nativity story tells how wise men, or magi, came to pay their homage to Jesus bringing him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.\nEach Christmas Eve, Latin Catholic priest, Father Jamal Khadr, accompanies the patriarch in a traditional procession from Jerusalem.  On the way to the Church of the Nativity, they are met by Palestinian Christians for a special mass at midnight.\nIn 2003, an 8m(26ft)-high concrete wall was erected in Bethlehem - part of Israel's barrier built in and around the West Bank.  A series of gates were constructed in the wall so that church leaders could continue to pass.\nNowadays clashes regularly take place by one of these gates.  Typically, young Palestinians throw stones, marbles and petrol bombs at Israeli soldiers who respond with tear gas, rubber bullets, skunk water and live rounds.\nIsrael blames the violence on incitement by Palestinian leaders and social media.  Father Jamal says that on the Palestinian side there are feelings of hopelessness and despair.\nLike Joseph, the husband of Mary, Jack Giacaman works with wood.  He carves large pieces himself and runs a workshop producing mainly religious items.\nHis main business involves traditional Nativity sets made out of olive wood grown in the holy land.  For centuries, such religious items have been sold to visiting pilgrims.\nAbout 40% of the Bethlehem economy relies directly on tourism.  However since the town was separated from Jerusalem by Israel's barrier, most tourists now enter through an Israeli checkpoint.\nLocal souvenir sellers say that restricted access to the city has greatly affected their trade.  They also complain about a system that sees large Palestinian stores pay a hefty commission to guides who bring in the tourists, which means many of the smaller shops lose out.\nInterviews, videos and pictures:  Yolande Knell, Jimmy Michael and Yousef Shomali\nVideo and web production: Alison Trowsdale and Sarah Fowler", "summary": "As Bethlehem prepares for Christmas, five people chosen to represent characters in the original Nativity story have been speaking about their hopes and fears for the festive period.", "id": "35155227"}

enter State House.\nAmong other things he wants a total overhaul of the electoral commission and direct appointment of the commissioners.\nHe believes the body as currently constituted is not credible and cannot oversee a credible electoral process in 2017.\nHe does not want reforms through a parliamentary process.\nHe knows very well the current government has enough numbers in the house to frustrate his efforts.\nHe is the MP for Gatundu South, a constituency in central Kenya that has produced two presidents - Jomo Kenyatta and Uhuru Kenyatta.\nHe is Kenya's Donald Trump (minus the billions and the presidential ambition): Straight-talking, unpredictable and uncontrollable.\nHe wants the opposition to tremble in their boots as they prepare for dialogue.\nFor the umpteenth time Mr Kuria is in trouble and facing serious charges of hate speech.\nMany Kenyans view him as the government's kamikaze - a force of self-destruction that also conveniently distracts attention from the ruling establishment.\nHe is the senator for Machakos County and a prominent opposition voice.\nHe is wealthy, loud and bold.\nHe will say the unsayable and often makes the government quite uncomfortable.\nMr Muthama is one of the eight legislators who were arrested for hate speech.\nHe is the chairman and face of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).\nHe does not want to go home -

{"document": "Few details of the deal agreed by the Russians and Americans have been released. There was indeed something of a decline in hostilities, though no comprehensive calm.\nThe ceasefire was supposed to open the way to aid deliveries in Syria, followed by the rolling out of a co-ordinated military campaign by Moscow and Washington against so-called Islamic State (IS) targets and other groups linked to al-Qaeda.\nIn practice the latest attacks on the aid convoy and hospital seem to have taken things back to square one. Indeed the cynicism of the attack on the convoy in particular is remarkable.\nThe Russians have shown drone footage of their monitoring of the convoy, the route and location of which were pre-announced. But what happened next is disputed.\nThe Americans are hinting strongly that the convoy was attacked from the air by a pair of Sukhoi Su-24 jets - either Russian or Syrian. It makes little difference to Washington, which holds Moscow responsible either way.\nIn contrast, the Russians deny any culpability; they say their aircraft were not in the area and that the destruction of the convoy was the result of action on the ground - the implication is from rebel forces.\nQuite what purpose anyone had in destroying the convoy is unclear, other than to jeopardise the ceasefire. But the seeds of its collapse were there from the outset.\nFirstly, the ceasefire was negotiated not between the warring parties on the ground but by two of their patrons - the US and Russia - who are both engaged in the conflict, in different ways and with very different goals.\nThe Syrian Government and the various rebel factions were not involved.\nSecondly, neither the Russians nor the Americans were able to convince their allies to accept the deal. Moscow had the easier job, to convince the Assad regime, which is hugely dependent upon Russia.\nThe Americans were able to convince some of the rebel groups to back the deal - but many others did not. Indeed many of them have no particular relationship with the Americans.\nFurthermore, the complex and untidy nature of the Syrian battlefield with multiple localised conflicts going on across the country, prosecuted by a variety of actors, made the idea of any ceasefire difficult from the outset.\nThe idea that the guns should fall silent in one war - between the Assad government and a variety of rebel groups - while the US and Russia put their foot on the accelerator in another battle against IS is a little bizarre.\nAny hammering of IS would create local vacuums into which one or other actor, the government or the rebels, might step.\nIn any case many at the Pentagon (and probably one would imagine some inside the Russian Defence Ministry as well) were far from enthusiastic about the proposed joint military campaign against IS.\nIf there was insufficient trust at the outset, then the attack on the aid convoy and the recriminations between Washington and Moscow now, have only made matters worse.\nThe conflict seems to be heading for a brutal stalemate as the fighting continues. The Assad regime is too weak to retake all the areas of the country it has lost. The rebel opposition too weak to seriously challenge it beyond the areas it already holds.\nThe Kurds as well as the Turkish incursion into Syria add an additional level of complexity to the problem. And as mentioned above the continued assault on IS will change the strategic map in Syria whatever happens elsewhere.", "summary": "While US Secretary of State John Kerry is not giving up on the idea of a ceasefire in Syria, it is very hard to see his efforts bearing fruit.", "id": "37433079"}

Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn).\nIn Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.

It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.\nThe petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.\nThe European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

Clubs are now attractive propositions to investors, and not merely as vanity projects.\"\nHe said increased profitability meant that top flight English clubs could compete with overseas teams in order to buy up the best players in the world, and still have money left in reserve.\nFrom 2016-17 clubs will receive even more cash from broadcasters, with Sky and BT Sport paying a record £5.136bn (up from £3.018bn in 2013-16) for live Premier League TV rights for three seasons.\n\"When the enhanced new broadcast deals commence in the 2016-17 season, operating profits could rise as high as £1bn,\" Mr Jones said.\nHe also said that it was encouraging to see that much of this new-found TV wealth was being spent by clubs not only on players, but also on improving stadia and infrastructure.\n\"The pace of football's financial growth in two and a half decades is staggering,\" said Mr Jones, referring to the foundation of the Premier League in 1992.\n\"By half-time of the second televised Premier League game next year, more broadcast revenue will have been generated than during the whole of the First Division season 25 years ago.\"\nHe added: \"The impact of the Premier League's broadcast deal is clear to see. For the first time, the Premier League leads the football world in all three key revenue categories - commercial, match day and broadcast - and this is driving sustainable profitability.\nAlthough the wages/revenue ratio has increased for the Premier League clubs, Mr Jones does not see this as cause for concern.\n\"Wage costs grew at a faster rate than revenues in 2014-15 and as a result the division's wages/revenue ratio rose from 58% to 61%,\" he said.\n\"However, this represents the second lowest level since 2004-05 and is 10 percentage points lower than in 2012-13.\n\"In fact, in the last two years, only 30% of revenue increases have been consumed by wage growth, whereas in the five years to 2012-13 this figure was 99%.\"\nPremier League highlights 2014-15\nThe 92 clubs in the English Premier League and Football League generated more than £4bn in revenues for the first time in 2014-15, a new record.\nMeanwhile,  the UK government's tax take from the top 92 professional football clubs in 2014-15 was roughly £1.5bn, up from £1.4bn the previous season.\nDeloitte's review of football finance also found that combined revenue for the \"big five\" European leagues (England, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France) rose 6% to a record €12bn (£9.2bn) in 2014-15.\nWhile the Premier League, Bundesliga and Spain's La Liga were profitable, Italy's Serie A and France's Ligue 1 generated combined operating losses.\nIn England's second tier, the Championship, combined revenues grew 12% to £548m in 2014-15, exceeding £500m for the first time.\n\"Wage costs rose by 4% to £541m which, despite a reduction in the wages/revenue ratio from 106% in 2013-14 to 99%, means clubs spent almost as much on wages as they generated in revenue,\" said Deloitte.\n\"This remains an unsustainable level of spending without the support of owner funding. This resulted in operating losses of £225m and a combined pre-tax loss of £191m.\"\nIn Scotland, Celtic's failure to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League contributed to a fall in Premiership clubs' aggregate revenues of 9%, or some £13m.\nHowever, the Glasgow club still accounted for 50% of all revenues in the division, as they lifted the title for a fourth successive year.\nDeloitte said a new deal to market the international (non EEA - European Economic Area) TV rights  meant Scottish football was now being shown in more than 100 countries.", "summary": "Increasingly large TV deals are helping English Premier League clubs to enter \"a new era of sustained financial performance\", according to Deloitte.", "id": "36412394"}

{"document": "Each evening Cardiff Bay will become the venue for a world music Showcase Festival featuring a tapas of world music from around the world.\nFolk music played a large part in this year's opening ceremony featuring Cerys Matthews and other leading Welsh musicians taking the audience on a journey of Welsh music and culture spanning 30,000 years.\nWe asked ten of the leading exponents of Wales' folk music to share songs that best represent what makes each tradition so unique.\nThe earliest surviving manuscript of harp music in Europe - the manuscript of Robert ap Huw, comes from Wales.\n\"The tablature of the Ap Huw manuscripts provide a vital insight into early, traditional music and his music is still celebrated and performed widely\" said internationally renowned harpist, Catrin Finch.\n\"Caniad Y Gwyn Bibydd\" (The Song of the White Piper) demonstrates his music's amazing ability to sound contemporary, even though it was written nearly five centuries ago.\"\nThis unique tradition of singing or chanting poetry to harp accompaniment is a direct descendent of the form used by early bards to intone poetry in praise of their kings and princes.\nGwenan Gibard, a musician and leading exponent of the tradition chose the track  Bum Yn Caru Cainc Y Datgeiniad by one of the old style singers, Einion Edwards, from Meirionydd - a stronghold of the tradition for centuries.\nConsidered by many to be Wales's national instrument, the triple harp was brought to Britain from continental Europe in around 1630. It became popular with harpists in London, many of whom were Welsh and brought it to Wales where it became popular amongst the Gipsy community.\n\"The 'shimmering' voice of the Triple Harp's three rows of strings is truly as timeless and unique as the Welsh language itself\" said Robin Huw Bowen, a full-time professional Welsh harpist specializing solely in the Welsh Triple Harp.\nThe track Pwt Ar Y Bys (Fingering Vamp) shows off the harp's capability and the Welsh tradition to great effect.\nIn many parts of Wales Christmas Day meant attending an early plygain service between 3-6am at the parish church.\nSinger Arfon Gwilym was brought up in the tradition and explains more: \"The plygain tradition survives mainly in Montgomeryshire and takes place in churches and chapels over a six week period during Christmas and the new year.\"\n\"After a short service, the plygain is declared open and anyone in the audience can take part, as individuals or as small parties, the most common party being three people, singing in close harmony. The singing is always unaccompanied and in the past was dominated by men who sang in a simple folk style that was unique.\"\nListen to Ar Gyfer Heddiw'r Bore by Triawd Fronheulog.\nWelsh ballads are still widely performed in their traditional forms but new generations of musicians are revisiting them and performing the songs in more contemporary styles, ensuring they remain relevant. In recent years, folk singer SiÃ¢n James has been at the forefront of this movement:\n\"A ballad which caught my imagination from a very young age was the very beautiful Yr Eneth gadd ei gwrthod (The rejected maiden) - a 19th Century ballad from the Cynwyd area near Bala, which tells the story of a young girl who, finding herself pregnant out of wedlock, is thrown out of her family home by her father, ostracised by her community and left destitute.\"\n\"It ends with the girl drowning herself. She is found with a water-sodden note in her hand, asking to be buried without a headstone, so her existence would be forgotten.\"\nDue to the work of enlightened individuals such as Lady Llanover in the 18th Century, a good many of Wales' traditional dance reels (folk dance and accompanying dance tune type) have survived. Stephen Rees is one of Wales's leading folk musicians and musicologists:\n\"This recording of Pibddawns y Sipsi performed by Nansi Richards, the original 'Queen of the Welsh Harp' conveys the 'hwyl' or spirit of our traditional dance music.\"\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, migrant workers from across the world flocked to Wales' coalfields, slate quarries and docks. The impact on small, Welsh speaking communities was immense and this period ignited a tradition of mixed language songs known as Macaronic.\nCerys Matthews is a huge fan and chose CÃ¢n Merthyr as one of her favourites. Initially, Macaronic songs were thought to be an oral tradition but handwritten records do exist in the National Library of Wales archives dated 1909.\nIts words are said to have been sold on the pamphlet of a ballad-singer at Merthyr Tydfil around the mid-19th Century.\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in Welsh language activism. While the rest of the western world was engaged in the hippy movement and the 'summer of love', Wales was rediscovering its folk music and traditions, fuelled by a surge in the popularity of Celtic music.\n\"We formed Ar Log in 1976, with the dream of being able to earn a living solely by playing traditional Welsh music\" said Dafydd Roberts, one of the founding members of Ar Log.\n\"By the early eighties Ar Log was travelling Europe and North & South America for around nine months of the year with a wealth of traditional Welsh folk music at our disposal, from haunting love songs and harp airs, to melodic dance tunes, and rousing sea shanties.\"\nThis medley of traditional folk songs comes from Ar Log's own repertoire: Twll yn y to / Cymro o Ble / Pedwar Post y Gwely\nDafydd Iwan is a singer-composer and political activist and campaigned during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s for official status for the Welsh language with Cymdeithas Yr Iaith, the Welsh Language Movement.\n\"Songs have been a natural medium for expressing strong emotions and political protest for centuries, and here in Wales there is a long tradition of ballads with a strong social and political theme,\" he said.\nPeintio'r Byd Yn Wyrdd (Painting the world green) grew out of the road-signs campaign for the Welsh language.\nMore and more young musicians are turning to the folk tradition for inspiration and helping to drive creative experimentation and collaborations.\nWelsh poet and singer-songwriter Gwyneth Glyn has recently been working on such a project with musicians from India and singer Tauseef Akhrar from Mumbai and incorporates Indian violin, tabla and Welsh harp.\nAnother recent project entitled Mamiaith (Mother Tongue), saw Welsh folk group 9Bach collaborate with Australian group Black Arm Band to explore the poignant theme of lost language. Gwyneth chose the track Cariad Mam (Mother's Love) from that album.\nToday, musical tradition in Wales is thriving as younger musicians turn to folk music for inspiration but continue to develop it further with rich musical collaborations around the world.\nWOMEX - The World's Music Comes To Wales is broadcast on BBC Two Wales, Sunday 27 October at 22:00 BST.", "summary": "This week musicians and music industry leaders from across the globe are in Cardiff as WOMEX, the world's leading World Music Expo arrives in Britain.", "id": "24557218"}

{"document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nWhat quickly became evident was the common theme at the heart of the warm words, stories and anecdotes: 'our' Blowers is unique.\nSpecial broadcasters like Henry cannot be created or coached - they just happen naturally.\nHe is, as everyone knows, a larger than life character who helped to create a legacy that marks out TMS as the envy of the broadcast world - both from within and outside the sport.\nIndeed, it was Henry who imparted some of the best advice I have ever received.\nI bumped into him on the first morning of my first Test as the cricket correspondent of the BBC. His advice was simple: be yourself. That's certainly what he is on air.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHenry makes every ball sound like an event, describing it with such energy, vividness and a wonderful use of language.\nHe also realises the importance of going beyond the narrow perspective of what is happening in the middle, bringing a PG Wodehouse flavour to proceedings.\nI can always tell when Henry is getting excited about play because his right leg will bounce up and down like a piston.\nHe brings pizzazz to the commentary box, where everyone has their role. I know when I'm sat alongside Henry that the colourful, eccentric and random side of things is taken care of.\nHe is one of a handful of people - the others being Brian Johnston, John Arlott, Christopher Martin-Jenkins, Fred Trueman, Trevor Bailey and Peter Baxter - who made TMS what it is today.\nWherever I go, people always want to talk to me about Henry. People are just fascinated by him.\nAnd he has changed in some respects.\nFor example, he used to dress rather traditionally with a jacket and bow tie. You would never say he was necessarily smart - but always traditional.\nThen he married an Italian lady called Valeria and all of a sudden, this radiant creature would turn up on the morning of the match wearing some shocking colours - yellow, purple, blue, green.\nOne thing which has never changed, however, is his insatiable appetite for his work - whether that is his theatre shows, writing books, public speaking or writing for newspapers.\nIt is probably only now that he has finally taken a step back and looked at things.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI have so many fond memories of Henry.\nBack in 1998, a Test in Jamaica was abandoned because of a dangerous pitch. I knew I was going to be busy but I was absolutely desperate for the toilet.\nThere was one toilet in the whole commentary box and I burst into the room, only to be faced with Henry delivering an elaborate report over the phone to a radio station.\nI had no choice - I had to go to the toilet, despite Henry being in full flow. Even when I pulled the chain, he did not break stride in his delivery.\nIt was typical Henry. Being the extraordinary man that he is, he just carried on.\nI have to admit that we often liked to play childish tricks on Henry.\nI remember once sending him a fax from my laptop at the back of the commentary box. I ripped off the fax and handed it to Henry.\nOn letter-headed paper for a carpet company which didn't exist I wrote something along the lines of: \"Dear Mr Blofeld, we think you are the best commentator on the radio, we always listen to you on the shop floor and if you mention us on air we'll send you a free carpet.\"\nHenry enthusiastically read out the message and put the paper in his jacket pocket, delighted he was to get a new carpet no doubt.\nHalf an hour later, I sent another fax from Smith's Carpets' equally fictitious rival, Jones's Carpets: \"Dear Mr Blofeld... we do not appreciate you blatantly plugging our rivals on air. Give us equal exposure or we'll be writing to the director general.\"\nHis face was a picture.

{"document": "It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.\n\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\nMr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\n\"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\n\"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\nBut clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\n\"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.\n\"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\n\"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\n\"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\nHe says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.\n\"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed.

He oversees the recruitment, development, training and management of hundreds of players in Manchester and at other global training centres.\n\"We have a great opportunity to lead in football, and are searching for the next trend. which will keep us ahead of everyone else,\" says Mr Marwood.\n\"We have got a team of people trying to find out what the next 10 to 20 years of football will look like. We want to be ahead of the game.\"\nTo that end, a research and innovation group for all four clubs is being created.\nAnother major goal is to use data to enhance the fan experience.\nCFG believes that with SAP's assistance they can change the way supporters of the group's four teams access and consume football data.\nTom Glick, president of New York City FC says that CFG will be looking to enhance the viewing experience of fans, whether \"glued to the action\" at the stadium, or sitting at home watching on TV.\n\"The task of finding new ways to get this information to the fans starts now,\" he says. \"We will be asking them what additional information and data about the game and players they would look to see - what is important to them.\"\nThe first innovation in this area will be a large digital statistics wall installed at Man City's Etihad Stadium from next season, which will show player and match statistics from the previous game.\n\"I can see the attraction in providing supporters with access to match data, particularly among the younger tech-aware generation in their teens and twenties,\" says Kevin Parker, secretary of the Man City supporters club.\n\"We have all got an opinion on how our players are playing during a game and whether a particular player - for example Fernandinho - has worked as hard or not as it appears to fans at the game,\" he says.\n\"Or you can confirm whether David Silva or Yaya Toure have played those key passes that you thought they had. That can all add to the whole spectacle and enjoyment of the game, and provide talking points.\"\nBut he warns that \"some of the more vociferous elements at a match might get on a player's back\" if their match data was not impressive.\nHe also says data overload might be a danger, particularly if chewing over match statistics at home overshadows the experience of attending a game in the flesh.\n\"Any data has to be handled and presented in the right way,\" he says.\nMeanwhile, the next step in enhancing that data collection for the group of clubs will be this October, when Melbourne City FC take to wearing player monitors during Australian league games.\n\"We believe we are doing something that has never been done before, around the world,\" says group chief executive Soriano of the tech route ahead.\n\"We have to take risks, innovate, make mistakes.\"", "summary": "\"You gotta roll with it,\" blares out Liam Gallagher as the Oasis hit combines with the rain  thundering onto the roof of Manchester City's indoor academy pitch.", "id": "33277924"}

In fact, according to a Reuters poll, the probability that the Fed was going to raise rates stood at 90% before the meeting.\nSo investors in Asia are prepared - and have been for the last couple of years.\nAnd they've been reacting - we've seen money being pulled out of equities in emerging markets in preparation for this move.\nCapital outflows from emerging markets are on track to exceed the amount that went into them this year for the first time since 1988, according to the Institute of International Finance.\nSo if immediate reaction isn't the concern - then what are the longer-term consequences of this rate rise for Asia?\nHere are the three things you should watch out for:\nWhen the US raises rates, the US dollar tends to rise which means other currencies depreciate against it.

We get a max of 1.5Mb.\nIt is frustrating in the extreme to see constant TV adverts for high speed broadband when ours is too slow to stream or watch BBC iPlayer etc.\nAs far as I'm aware there is no date or plan to upgrade this area.\nByron Raistrick, of Ruthwell, emailed: Since the announcement by the Scottish Executive that the initiative was up and running, I've not seen any evidence of the Â£126m being distributed fairly and efficiently to the areas that need it most - rural locations.\nMajor cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh would have been upgraded as a matter of course by BT Openzone to cater for the businesses there and in turn the residential areas would have benefited, yet (they) have been upgraded first with the money.\nLinda Lonsdale emailed: We pay extra money to get superfast broadband and it is not any faster load of rubbish conned again.\nSusan Cook emailed: Broadband speed in our village  0.9Mb and sometimes even lower. We have been told by BT that it will be four to six years before we get anything better! And we pay the same as all their other customers.\nThere are  people living in the Borders other than in Melrose and Galashiels yet no consideration is given to them.\nSiobhan Liehne emailed: We live on the Mellerstain Estate near Gordon. We keep reading of ministers complaining that constituents in some Borders areas are \"only getting 2Mbps\". Frankly I would give my eyeteeth for that kind of speed.\nWe get 0.7 Mbps if we are lucky and sometimes it drops out altogether. Then we have to see signs up telling us that towns only a very short distance away are getting superfast. When we ring BT to try and find out when things are going to improve we get someone in India telling us that it must be our computer.\nIf it is, then it's every computer on the estate, no matter how new it may be.\nAndrew Gray emailed: I live near Chirnside in the Scottish Borders which is enabled for fibre broadband. However only those residents who live within a mile of the cabinet can get anything like the speeds advertised.\nMy house is two and a half miles from the cabinet so the fibre signal does not reach it at all. According to most comparison websites (including BT's) I can receive broadband speeds of up to 40Mb but in practice I get just over 2Mb, if I'm lucky.\nThere should be further scrutiny of how public money has been spent on improving broadband services, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that everyone can benefit in the future.\nHenry Sinclair emailed: I live in Earlston and have what the major players call \"superfast\" broadband - ie fibre to the cabinet, which is 100m away or just over 200m of copper wire.\nThe actual speeds I get vary between 20 and 70Mbps download and 15 to 20Mbps upload.\nMy grandson who lives no more than 400m from me and 300m from a cabinet can only achieve a max of 6Mbps and pays the same as me.\nCopper is a 19th century answer to a 21st century question but BT continues to squander taxpayers' money on using it to provide an inadequate or in some cases no service while the solution is staring it in the face.  As the internet moves from a consumer model to an interactive one the pathetic download speeds and risible upload speeds will hold us all back and eventually our interconnection system will have to be re-engineered using fibre.  Why not do it now rather than throwing billions at a known fatally flawed approach?\nBrian Telfer emailed: I have had issues since BT started to enable the Hawick exchange well over a year ago. I was getting better speed and reliability before the exchange was enabled for fibre.\nI am now on fibre at double the price, with continual buffering drops in service and regular visits from engineers who contradict each other - speed can be from 1.52Mb to 20Mb - not the 52 Mbps I am paying for.\nUploads are a joke - I now use my phone tethered to the computer to upload anything!\nPeter Dorward emailed: I read your report with interest particularly the part that referred to over Â£8m being invested in super fast broadband by SBC and that 94% of homes will have it.\nAt the moment why not focus attention on getting something like 'normal' broadband speeds to all households.\nWe have struggled at trying to conduct work when at home when only being able to access broadband internet with speeds that are barely any better than a dial up service!\nAny pressure that can be brought to get us to first base is welcomed.\nCarole emailed: We live in Bonnington Road in Peebles in a modern house and our broadband speed is very poor we are with BT and get 2Mb which is a joke. Believe one of our neighbours gets better speed. When you try to raise it with BT you don't get anywhere. Poor show ... what's fibre optic? Even a bit better speed would be appreciated fibre optic is a dream for us.\nDavid Jeffrey emailed: I work in broadband provision for local councils in the south of the country. I believe the councillor is correct in her assertion of expecting speed provision to be constant.\nBoth BT and the industry are living in the last century of squeezing the last penny of investment out of the copper infrastructure in the ground.\nAdmittedly fibre is not cheap, but the trial in York proves that fibre to the home is achievable with the right partnerships (CityFibre, Sky and TalkTalk in that case)\nDigital Scotland should be delivering more, but as long as BT have the monopoly over the infrastructure, nothing will change.\nHowever, this constant and reliable speed will come at a cost, and there is the rub. Will subscribers pay for it?\nI expect not. It is worth noting that businesses in south of Scotland (and anywhere else in rural UK) have enjoyed fibre services for many years, but have had to pay top whack for the privilege.\nBrian Heslop emails: I live in Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway. We're on a farm, so were considered too remote for coverage, the cabinets are located within a few hundred yards of the exchange so the cabinet is still 2.5 miles from the house.\nAs the exchange is one where the one broadband provider is BTopenreach, so all the advertised cheap offers from EE, TalkTalk, Sky etc are not available. So the double hit of slow broadband and the highest prices.\nPart of the problem is the politicians not understanding what BT are selling them, it was never going to give a good service to all, using an urban solution in a rural environment.\nLindsay Lewis emailed: We are lucky if we get 1.5Mb because we are several miles from the exchange.  BT have not upgraded our exchange (Yarrow)  and seem unlikely to do so.  Why?  Because there aren't enough people/customers to make it worth their while.  It is a disgrace - we pay the same as someone getting up to 50Mb, and what makes it even more galling is that BT are continually sending us marketing material urging us to sign up to BT Infinity!  So for the foreseeable future we will continue to live in the digital dark ages.\nJason W emailed: BT need to wake up and smell the coffee.\nCopper phone lines are dead assets - they will need to be replaced with fibre optic right to the premises sooner or later. If the cost of upgrading to actual fibre to the premises wasn't so outlandish, I'd do it in a heartbeat.", "summary": "The speed of broadband in southern Scotland has provoked some intense discussion.", "id": "36488825"}

He later attended Alexandra Infant School from the age of five and then went to Alexandra Junior School.\nAt school, he enjoyed all sports, but especially football and swimming. He was more keen than talented, but he always turned up on time with his kit and helped the teacher to get everything ready.\nProfiles of all those who died\nFrom the time that he was in junior school, everyone knew that his favourite team was Liverpool Football Club.\nHis love of the club was encouraged by his grandad, who was a Liverpudlian, and also his dad, who appreciated a good team. His favourite players were Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush and John Barnes.\nPaul was a member of the church choir where the vicar's son was also a Liverpool fan.\nOn prize-giving evenings at school, Paul would sit patiently, hoping against hope that he would get one of the awards, but it was never to be.\nIn September 1986, Paul moved to Sandon High School, where his older sister was already a student.\nHe was really happy when he was picked to play in the school football and basketball teams. By then he had joined the food technology class and had started to enjoy cooking at home, too.\nPaul was really popular with his school friends and neighbours, young and old. After Paul died, the elderly lady who lived next door to us told us how he used to run down the hill where we lived to help carry her shopping home for her.\nShe also told us how he would sit on her garden wall and describe all the plants and flowers in her garden to her. The reason he would do this is because she was almost blind, and I guess this was his way of helping her to see the garden.\nUnfortunately, we did not know any of this until after Paul died.\nPaul also played football for a local 'lads and dads' team. He was a very popular team player and he always enjoyed playing with them and having the support of his dad there.\nBy the end of 1989, Paul's name was on several trophies. Both schools he attended had organised special awards in his honour and we were asked to present them to the winners.\nWe agreed as long as they were for the boy or girl who was most helpful, reliable, always smiling and a pleasure to have in school, someone such as Paul himself. The two trophies are still awarded to this day.\nPaul often said, \"I want to be famous\". In a strange way, his wish was granted in a small part of Stoke-on-Trent.", "summary": "A schoolboy from Stoke-on-Trent, Paul Murray travelled to the match on a Liverpool Supporters' Club coach with his father, Tony Murray, who survived", "id": "27207442"}

{"document": "The 51-year-old London mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gravitas of his various roles with an unkempt, humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life.\nPrime Minister David Cameron expressed his delight when Mr Johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015, saying: \"I want my star players on the pitch.\"\nBut now the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said he will campaign against the PM in the EU referendum, relations between the two may become more tense.\nThe big question is whether the blond-haired old Etonian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it.\nHe has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister.\nWhen he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura.\nThe hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.\nHe swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio.\nGiven the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters.\nBut crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign.\nAlthough lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free.\nIn 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq.\nThe following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair.\nHe created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to \"get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like\".\nLater he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as \"too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs\" and associating Papua New Guinea \"with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing\".\nThe London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language.\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire.\nThe son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival.\nAt Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor.\nIn his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture.\nHis decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54% to 47%.\nDays after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as \"Boris bikes\", and ditched the \"bendy bus\" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers.\nAlthough suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson.\nHe was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas.\nMr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers.\nIn 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do \"another big job in politics\" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value.\nMr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe.\nHis latest decision means that speculation is guaranteed to continue.", "summary": "Boris Johnson's decision to campaign for Britain to leave the EU is being regarded as a huge boost for the Out campaign.", "id": "35625669"}
{"document": "Research suggest animals that build their nests in early spring may win the fight for available habitat at the expense of late breeders.\nConservation efforts should focus on ensuring rare species have enough places to nest, say scientists.\nFor example, areas could be left to grow wild between spring and summer to help bumblebees establish nests.\nHabitats such as hedgerows and hay meadows are being lost in many countries, meaning that fewer nesting sites are available.\nCompetition among animals for a suitable place to nest could explain why some species are struggling to survive.\n\"Ecologists understand why some groups of species are declining more, such as why farmland species are declining more than woodland species,\" said Dr Andrew Higginson of the University of Exeter.\n\"But an enduring mystery is the big variation in the declines of closely related species. Fighting over nest sites may be part of the reason - when nest sites are hard to come by, the species that will suffer most are those that nest later in the year.\"\nThe University of Exeter study analysed population changes in more than 200 bird species and 40 bumblebee species around the world.\nThe population data was combined with a mathematical model that used game theory to predict the likely behaviour of bees and birds when faced with competition for nesting sites.\nIt calculated the implications of fighting for nesting sites, based on the size of each species, the time of nesting and the quality of the nesting site.\nThe study found larger species that nest early generally do better, while smaller bees and birds that nest later in the year lose out in the struggle for habitat.\nFor example, the chaffinch is doing well in the UK, while the goldfinch is on the decline.\n\"We need to have a more holistic approach to providing good habitat for animals,\" Dr Higginson told BBC News. \"We need to worry about the whole life cycle not just what they eat.\"\nHe said conservation efforts for animals such as birds and bees tend to focus on providing food.\nRestoration and provision of nest sites should be an urgent priority, he said.\nThis could be as simple as waiting to cut hedgerows until later in the year when all animals have nested or providing more boxes for birds to nest in.\nThe research is published in the journal, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology.\nFollow Helen on  Twitter.", "summary": "Competition for nesting sites could explain why some birds and bumblebees are declining faster than others.", "id": "40260319"}

And he believes improvements can be seen already.\n\"I don't want to hide behind the fact we're devastated to have been eliminated in the group stages,\" Ashworth said. \"We're disappointed with the group that we hoped and thought might go a bit further. But there are some success stories.\n\"In order to win things at senior level, we need to develop players who can deal with the ball in all areas of the pitch. We have to prioritise that in the development teams.\n\"They're young players and they'll make mistakes - it will cost us games. We have to accept that. We can't after six months say that's wrong, let's just crash it down the other end as quickly as we can.\n\"We're starting to see a different kind of player come through the system now.

It's not the players or coaching staff. It's not one thing, it's an accumulation of many things.\n\"The culture in English football isn't changing. No St George's Park, no massive spend, no changing coach will change it. The culture is rotten from top to bottom.

I need to rest because I want to play in the Europa League or Champions League next year'.\n\"Or 'hang on it's better for my career not to go to this tournament'. Or their managers are saying it.

Gareth has only been in the job two years. Things don't change overnight. Changing the way England play and players develop will take 10 years at least. That's what the Germans had to do before becoming very successful.\n\"Do they get too much too soon? It's very difficult for the coaching staff.

{"document": "For £39m, the firm is buying what is estimated to be up to a quarter of the timber released by NRW every year.\nAuditor General Huw Vaughan Thomas said he was unable to satisfy himself on whether the decision to make the deal was lawful.\nNRW disputed the findings.\nThe allegations have been made in a response to the 2015/16 accounts of NRW by Mr Thomas, who called the deal \"irregular\".\nHe said the decision-making process was not transparent and expressed \"doubt\" over whether it met EU state aid rules.\n\"I have not been able to satisfy myself that the decision to agree those contracts was lawful and did not involve the provision of state aid,\" he wrote.\nThe identity of the company has not been revealed because NRW said the matter was commercially sensitive.\nAs a condition of the contract, the company said it would construct and operate a new saw line at its Welsh premises by 31 March 2016 but NRW said that condition was not met and was extended by 12 months.\nNRW would not say whether the condition had been met since last March.\nA report by the auditor general said that in 2014, NRW entered into an agreement with a sawmill operator for eight connected timber sales contracts, in a bid to try to halt the spread of a disease.\nThe firm purchased both spruce and larch timber, the latter of which was from forests where a fungus disease - P Ramorum - that causes extensive damage was present.\nBut the report said no other potential purchasers were given the opportunity to bid for the timber.\nThe value of the contract was designed to enable the operator to make a major investment in the sawmill - the operator said four of the contracts for larch would not have been enough to invest in the new saw line.\nNRW told auditors it had to act, that there was no alternative and that it was highly unlikely that any other operators would have been interested.\nBut Mr Thomas believed the 10-year-long deal would have been an opportunity other operators may have been interested in.\nThis, the lack of market testing and the fact NRW admitted in internal documents that the award of the contract gave rise to the risk of challenge by another company, led the auditor to believe it should have been referred to Welsh Government because it was contentious and could have repercussions on the wider market.\nBut it was not referred to the Welsh Government in that way, and as a result the contracts were \"irregular\" in the auditor's view.\nMr Thomas also said that the awarding of contracts to the sawmill operator was neither \"robust nor transparent\", saying NRW was unable to provide \"sufficient contemporaneous documentation\" that demonstrated what it took into account when it decided to enter the contracts.\n\"In the absence of sufficient evidence, I have been unable to satisfy myself that NRW's decision to enter into these contracts with the sawmill operator was taken in accordance with public law principles,\" he wrote.\nThe auditor said his uncertainty did not mean the contracts should now be regarded as unlawful or represent poor value for money.\nHe added that NRW \"failed to follow appropriate processes for ensuring that the outputs for which it contracted with the sawmill operator were obtained on market terms\".\n\"This failure gives rise to doubt as to the compliance of the contracts with... state aid rules.\"\nNRW has disputed his conclusions on both the issue of law and state aid.\nIt said it strongly believed the contracts were lawful and said it had legal advice that supported that view.\nIt said the spread of the P Ranorum disease, which happened within the first year of NRW's existence, gave rise to exceptional circumstances.\nKevin Ingram of NRW said: \"We are disappointed with the WAO's findings regarding aspects of some long-term sales contracts.\n\"Nevertheless, we have an action plan to learn the lessons from this to ensure even stronger governance arrangements in future.\"\nBut he said the audit and other reports showed \"NRW is a well-governed and managed organisation\".\n\"We are pleased it has found our financial reporting is fair and accurate,\" he said.\nChairman of the assembly's Public Accounts Committee, Conservative AM Nick Ramsay, said he was \"very concerned\" by the report.\n\"It's now important that Public Accounts Committee questions officials from the body at the earliest opportunity,\" he said.\nThe matter was discussed at the assembly's finance committee on Wednesday -

While they did pull one goal back when Bacuna slotted in as Stoke appealed for handball against Rudy Gestede in the build-up, they never looked like taking anything from the game.\nApart from Bacuna's strike, the only occasions when a Villa player looked like putting the ball in the net was when defender Jores Okore twice nearly scored own goals, both times being spared by excellent saves from Mark Bunn.\nIt might be stating the obvious but relegation is surely a certainty.\nMark Hughes' side went into this game on the same points total as this stage last season and the victory keeps them on target for another top-10 finish.\nAfter three successive 3-0 losses in the league, Stoke have rebounded by beating Bournemouth and Aston Villa and look again like one of the Premier League's most stubborn opponents.\nArnautovic was their catalyst throughout, creating their best openings in a poor first half before netting both their goals as the Potters effectively won the game in the first 15 minutes of the second period.\nWhile Stoke's set-pieces were often poor, they were always a threat from the flanks in open play.

{"document": "Glory and grounding. Fight for medals, learn your craft. The stage marries pressure of the here and now with a gateway to a professional future.\nBritish fighters know the pathway only too well - consider 2008 Olympians James DeGale and Billy Joe Saunders, both now professional world champions.\nThe latest off that conveyor belt, IBF heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, thinks Britain has a \"unique\" fighter waiting to make the transition to the pro ranks.\nHere, with the help of Joshua, former Olympic bronze medallist and WBC super-middleweight champion Richie Woodhall, and BBC Radio 5 live pundit Steve Bunce, we take a look at the decisions facing Great Britain's 2016 Olympians.\nSuper-heavyweight Joe Joyce will leave the comforts of the state-of-the-art British Boxing training base in Sheffield as an Olympic silver medallist, braced for life as a pro, dreaming of emulating the success of previous gold medal winners in his weight class Wladimir Klitschko, Lennox Lewis and Joshua himself.\n\"Joe Joyce is unique,\" says Joshua of the fighter who holds a degree in fine arts.\n\"He's very intelligent, he's experienced different things, you can see he is a really solid athlete. He has got people eating out of his hand. He has so much energy.\"\nJoyce, 30, is quietly spoken to the cameras but ultra-confident in the ring. A competitive swagger perhaps supported by 2014 Commonwealth Games gold and European Games gold in 2015.\nHe didn't start boxing until he was 22, following a chance introduction to the sport while at university. He is also a part-time model and unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in the James Bond film, Spectre.\n\"He is most suited to turn pro out of the 12 in the GB squad at this time,\" says Woodhall, who turned pro after the Commonwealth Games in 1990. \"At his age, his engine is more developed. I say that from my own experience as I recall how I felt at say 22 compared to when I was Joe's age. My fitness was more developed for the 12 rounds.\"\n'Adams could set the pro game alight and get it to the same level as the men's' - 5 Live In Short\nJoyce is the oldest male fighter in the British squad. Time is of the essence if he is to attain the Las Vegas dreams those in the fight game seem to universally harbour.\nThe pro move fascinates, we seem to obsess over it. At virtually every news conference in Rio came the question \"will you now turn pro?\"\nIn June, the contentious decision was made to allow professionals to compete. However, it is not as simple as it may seem with the IBF stating in advance of the Rio Games that any boxer competing in Brazil would be stripped of their title.\nThe IBF claimed it was a safety risk for professionals to face amateurs.\n\"If I'm to be perfectly honest, I don't think there's anyone apart from Joyce that's ready for the pro game because they are all very young,\" added Woodhall, who works with GB's amateurs twice a week.\n\"The more international experience you have in amateur or Olympic boxing, the better you are prepared for the pro game because you are experiencing so many styles of fighter. Too many of our amateurs turn pro far too soon.\"\nSix of the seven male British fighters from London 2012 have now had a pro bout. Britain's Rio 2016 elite were a fresh crop, delivering three medals as a squad, while Cuba led the way in the ring with six.\n\"The Cubans, the Kazakhs, the Russians, the Ukrainians, they all keep their guys from four years ago,\" said Bunce. \"It's quite absurd. If only we could keep ours, persuade them not to go chasing the money, the money will be there [in the future].\"\nPromoters may promise big fights, big cheques, progression to domestic and world titles, yada, yada. The amateur game can sometimes be painted as a poor relation, not the sacred test many would argue it is.\nA Team GB fighter can earn up to £28,000 a year in basic funding. They can have food, physio and costs of living four days a week in camp covered, while training at a centre often visited by rival nations on research missions, such is its standing.\n\"When you turn pro you're funding yourself, you become your own boss,\" added Joshua, gold medallist at London 2012.\n\"You have to find a nutritionist, a physio, training grounds and it all comes at a cost. You have to look at the whole idea of being left to your own devices and finding good people to work with.\n\"You have to look at the system that made you successful and try to use it as a professional.\"\nLife on the other side offers an allure often too strong to resist, but there can be struggles. Audley Harrison - Olympic super heavyweight champion in 2000 - found pro life tough, Luke Campbell has tasted defeat in the paid ranks. Gold medals do not stop punches.\nBut Joshua's 30-month march from pro debut to heavyweight champion provides hope of glorious transition. He remains the only class of 2012 fighter to even contest a world title. Will the bright lights among which he now lives come calling for the 2016 team?\n\"He's made for the pro game,\" says Bunce of Joshua Buatsi, a bronze medallist at light heavyweight in Rio.\nBuatsi - still only 23 - displayed knockout power in Brazil. The St Mary's University student showed desire for a finish rather that the point-snatching style which historically shines in Olympic boxing.\n\"He fights like a pro,\" Bunce added. \"These Olympics have been more pro minded than any Olympics since 1980. These guys are having rows. The new scoring system means a return to old style blood, guts and thunder Olympic boxing which anyone above the age of 35 will remember falling in love with when they were younger.\"\nBuatsi could fall in love with offers from promoters post-Rio, although Joyce is still the only GB fighter to state he will certainly go over.\nWoodhall hopes for an amateur stay for the Ghana-born fighter, who claims Floyd Mayweather said he was \"a future world champion\" during a chance meeting in Rio.\n\"To win bronze here with the international experience he has had which is very little, then another four years into Joshua Buatsi and you'd probably see him winning gold,\" added Woodhall.\nSo have we seen our Anthony Joshua moment at Rio 2016? Have we seen a star born?\nThe desire is there but how greedy are we? Great Britain is home to 14 world champions. British Boxing did not choose 12 fighters to go to Rio, they delivered 12 for a maximum of 13 spaces in tough qualifying. These are heady times.\nNicola Adams did what Nicola Adams does to take gold and eight of the 10 male fighters in Brazil were under the age of 25.\n\"We hit our medal target and should retain our funding,\" added Woodhall. \"There's more to come from this team. I'm pretty sure we will win more than three medals in Tokyo.\"\nJoshua added: \"I think the guys that didn't manage to medal gained valuable experience and if they stay on until Tokyo we will see these guys shine.\"\nIt may hurt British Boxing bosses a little to see only Adams, Buatsi, Joyce and Savannah Marshall progress past the last-16 stage, but young fighters will \"develop power and learn from mistakes\" as their journey progresses, according to Joshua.\nSo switch now, or soak up more knowledge?\nBunce added: \"All 10 of the men will win British titles. As many as six or seven will end up winning a version of the world title.\"\nThat's expectation and with it comes pressure.

{"document": "The adware - dubbed Superfish - was potentially compromising their security, said experts.\nThe hidden software was also injecting adverts on to browsers using techniques more akin to malware, they added.\nLenovo faces questions about why and for how long it was pre-installed on machines - and what data was collected.\nThe company told the BBC in a statement: \"Lenovo removed Superfish from the preloads of new consumer systems in January 2015.  At the same time Superfish disabled existing Lenovo machines in the market from activating Superfish.\n\"Superfish was preloaded on to a select number of consumer models only.  Lenovo is thoroughly investigating all and any new concerns raised regarding Superfish.\"\nUsers began complaining about Superfish in Lenovo's forums in the autumn, and the firm told the BBC that it was shipped \"in a short window from October to December to help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping\".\nUser feedback, it acknowledged, \"was not positive\".\nLast month, forum administrator Mark Hopkins told users that \"due to some issues (browser pop up behaviour, for example)\", the company had \"temporarily removed Superfish from our consumer systems until such time as Superfish is able to provide a software build that addresses these issues\".\nHe added it had requested that Superfish issue an auto-update for \"units already in market\".\nSuperfish was designed to help users find products by visually analysing images on the web to find the cheapest ones.\nSuch adware is widely regarded in the industry as a form of malware because of the way it interacts with a person's laptop or PC.\nSecurity expert from Surrey University Prof Alan Woodward said: \"It is annoying.

Intimate gatherings and online forums have sprung like roses from the concrete.\nNWN is one group that has successfully carved out a space.\nFounded five years ago, the spoken-word poetry event has relied on mailing-list invites and donated venues to escape censorship and police intervention.\nA platform for free expression, where Arabic and English-speaking poets enjoy what my friend Sara Elhassan describes as an open mic that is actually \"open\".\nA luxury in the heavily guarded city, the event has survived raids, threats and scrutiny from National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), which reserves the right to disband public gatherings.\nIt has even resonated around the world when a video of a poetic performance in Arabic and English by Ms Elhassan went viral in 2014.\nThe poem, a response to a Sudanese professor's comment on television that he was unhappy about the unsatisfying levels of beauty exhibited by his country's women, put fresh air into the stale public arena of discussion and expression.\n\"Apparently, we're nothing butâ€¦ pretty faces put on display, to be bought and sold, and later stored as after-thoughts.

They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp.\nHe says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable.\nMr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.\n\"It's all about the money, it's not about the people,\" he added. \"I thought inspections would be made.\"\nNearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m.\nThe council said it has a \"dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable\".\nMatt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: \"We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.\"\nSamir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees.\nHe also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords \"who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients\".\nHe also said his company was \"genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property\".\nFresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants.\nIt also said it did not have \"authority from the relevant parties\" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions.\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for \"rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing\".", "summary": "A letting agency has been paid more than £5.5m in housing benefit after its owner set up a charity to help the homeless, the BBC has learned.", "id": "34743526"}

Former England captain Michael Vaughan said that he felt conned by the impression that Trescothick and Trott's cases were similar.\n\"A lot of players come to talk to me about things and I'm happy to speak to them but I have my own issues and everyone is very different,\" said Yardy.\n\"It is very dangerous to say that one case of depression is the same as another.\"\n\"It is now very clear that Jonathan Trott was not in the same boat as Marcus Trescothick,\" Sky News Sports editor Nick Powell added.\nStories about mental health issues tend to focus on the trauma suffered, rather than the triumph over the odds.\n\"We never talk about positive mental health, it is always seen negatively,\" said Bennett.\n\"We need to change that around so it is seen as a positive that someone is confident enough to come forward and share their issues.\"\n\"People who have suffered with mental health are actually very strong in that they have kept it inside so long and continued on in spite of it,\" added Yardy.\nIt is the white noise to which the serious business of the dressing room is played out to - joking and joshing, mockery and mirth. But does banter have to stop when it comes to mental illness?\n\"In a strange way I embrace it, because the worse thing can be that people feel they can't have a joke with you,\" said Yardy.\n\"People do take the mickey out of me, but in a closed environment and they know the boundaries.

{"document": "But the inspiration for this scheme to improve health services in Zambia began in very low-tech and unhappy circumstances.\nHuw Jones, working in Zambia as a safari guide, was driving a Land Rover along a road in a remote part of the country.\nHe saw a trail of blood in the road, and his first reaction was that it might have come from an animal killed by a lion.\nBut he came across a couple on a bike - the man riding and the woman carried on the handlebars.\nShe was pregnant and bleeding heavily and they had been cycling for hours with the aim of reaching the nearest hospital, almost 60 miles away.\nThe woman was in a great deal of pain and her husband seemed to be in a state of shock, says Mr Jones.\n\"In the heat and that terrain, they were desperate,\" he says.\nMr Jones stopped to pick them up and drive them.\nBut the woman was already weak and died in the back of the Land Rover before they could reach anyone who could give them medical help.\n\"It affected me quite deeply. I wondered if I could do anything,\" says Mr Jones.\nIt was an awful example of the lack of medical provision for rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa - and, he says, he has come across too many deaths that could have been avoided with better care.\nZambia has about 1,600 doctors for a population of 14 million, and two-thirds of these are working in towns and cities, while most of the country's population is in the countryside.\nIt means access to good quality health care is often difficult if not impossible.\nWhen Mr Jones returned to the UK, he began to develop a project to fill some of these gaps.\nHe set up the Virtual Doctors charity, based in Brighton, which uses the expertise of volunteer doctors in the UK to provide direct and individual support for health workers in Zambia.\nFor many communities, it is not practical to expect sick and frail people to walk or cycle for hours to hospital.\nSo families depend on rural health centres, which have health workers but no qualified doctors.\nThe virtual doctors project means that these isolated health centres can be supported by doctors thousands of miles away.\nHealth workers and clinical officers on the ground use an app on a smartphone or tablet computer to take notes on a patient's symptoms and photographs.\nThis information is sent to a volunteer doctor in the UK who helps with a diagnosis and recommends treatment.\nMore stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch\nCases are directed towards doctors with a relevant specialism, whether it is skin diseases or HIV and Aids-related problems.\nThe doctor in the UK will have a list of the drugs and equipment kept in the health centre in Zambia and can suggest treatment or further tests based on what is practical and available.\n\"For instance, there's no point calling for an MRI scan,\" says Mr Jones.\nVirtual Doctors is now supporting 19 rural health centres, which typically deal with problems such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/Aids and pregnancy-related conditions.\nThere are also two district hospitals taking part in the project.\nMr Jones says that even where there are facilities such as X-ray machines, there can be a shortage of radiologists to look at the evidence.\nThe virtual doctors in the UK have been able to help with chest X-rays of patients in Zambia, he says.\nThese local health centres have catchment areas of tens of thousands of people, and hospitals provide services for hundreds of thousands. And Mr Jones says the virtual doctors are now supporting health services for almost a million people.\nThe charity wants to expand further, with discussions in progress about working with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Tanzania and Uganda.\nMobile-phone networks are improving, and that could mean moving to more direct, real-time ways of communicating, such as video conferencing.\nBut Mr Jones says the emphasis must be on a system that is robust, simple, reliable and can be depended upon to work.\nThe app used to connect the virtual doctors was itself made by volunteer coders and developers from the Landmark Information Group in Exeter, working in their spare time.\nFormer Education Secretary Charles Clarke, who is supporting the project, describes it as a \"brilliant initiative that brings together voluntary expertise and desperate need\".\nThe Virtual Doctor system has been backed by the Zambian government.\nMuyeba Chikonde, Zambia's high commissioner in the UK, said he was very pleased at the assistance being provided.\nHe said it was in the spirit of \"ubuntu\" - a word used in southern Africa to suggest a philosophy of sharing and showing \"humanity towards others\".", "summary": "The idea of a \"virtual doctor\" project might sound rather futuristic.", "id": "36576510"}
{"document": "It is one of the key ways they say they are going to pay for their spending promises. Should we believe them?\nFirst of all, tax avoidance and evasion are very different things.\nTax avoidance is legal and includes things that some people would consider to be normal tax planning.\nSome parties refer to \"aggressive tax avoidance\". That is also legal but may involve the use of lawyers and accountants to find ways of avoiding tax that were not intended when tax regulations were introduced.\nTax evasion is illegal. It seems odd for political parties to say they are going to clamp down on tax evasion. It is like saying you are going to clamp down on theft and then putting a figure on how much you are going to save by doing so. On the plus side, it is unlikely that voters will say it is the wrong thing to do.\nThe Conservatives say they will save £5bn by clamping down on avoidance and evasion, the Liberal Democrats say £6bn and Labour tops the claims at £7.5bn.\nPaul Johnson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: \"All three parties are just making up numbers, quite honestly.\"\n\"Who knows whether that's feasible? Who knows whether that's the kind of money that's achievable? And frankly we'll never know.\"\nAnd this is the key problem - it is very difficult to predict how much you can save by clamping down on avoidance and evasion, but Revenue & Customs (HMRC) also finds it very difficult to work out how much has been saved in the past.\nIt can tell you some of it. For example, it can tell you how much it has won at tax tribunals when there has been a legal dispute.\nAnd it can try to put a figure on the outcome of specific policies, such as the tax cooperation agreement between the UK and Switzerland.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility initially predicted that policy would raise £5.3bn.\nBut it later had to cut this figure to £1.9bn, which gives an idea of the margin of error in such forecasts.\nWhen looking at a particular set of Budget anti-avoidance measures, the OBR concluded some had raised more than expected and some less, so the overall outcome had been pretty much as expected, which confirmed its warning that \"avoidance costings are subject to significant uncertainty\".\nWhy is it so difficult? Look at Labour's plans to abolish non-dom status, which was the subject of a previous Reality Check.\nWhen you change the tax regulations, especially the way you tax the very rich, people tend to change their behaviour.\nWith non-doms, we do not know how much tax they would be paying if they did not enjoy this status. And it would be very difficult in retrospect to work out how much more tax had been raised as a result of its abolition.\nTo Labour's credit, it has not tried to put precise figures on the amount they would raise from the abolition, but it is part of their £7.5bn claim.\nThe Conservatives say they have raised £7bn by clamping down on avoidance, and point to this document to support their claim.\nSo maybe the figures are improving, although the publication is a bit short of detail.\nOn the other hand, this document from HMRC estimates that in 2012-13, £7.2bn was lost to the exchequer by avoidance and evasion.\nNow, it may have risen considerably since then, but if £7bn has been saved already, it is hard to see where the extra billions are going to come from in the next Parliament.\nWhat's the truth behind the politicians' claims on the campaign trail?

The people were saying no to those who had promised to stop the deal.\nWhat puts this victory in a more meaningful context is the fact that it was achieved despite almost all well-known reformists being banned from running in the elections and a complete lack of media coverage of their campaign in the run-up to the elections.\nState TV and media never gave equal coverage to reformists or moderate candidates and even led a campaign against the deal in recent months.\nThe only medium available to pro-government candidates was the internet and social media, which they used to the maximum in getting their message across, especially to the young and women.\nThe triumph of the reformists should lead to a major realignment within parliament, making it more supportive of President Rouhani.\nBut it will by no means end the president's problems when it comes to delivering his election promises.\nThe nuclear deal has hit some rough patches on its way to implementation.\nApart from domestic oppositions from hardliners in parliament and other unelected bodies, there are still a lot of obstacles to overcome outside of Iran.\nThe international banks still have not opened up to Iranian businesses and in the US, conservatives in Congress are doing all they can to derail the deal.\nAny more delays in its implementation and ensuing lifting of sanctions would harm President Rouhani's economic reform plans and would prepare the ground for hardliners to recover from the this week's defeat in order to reshape their campaign against the government.\nTime is not on the moderates' side and the new momentum could die down easily if it is not supported by economic rewards.\nThis is a worry that every unseated hardliner MP is focusing on from now onwards.", "summary": "The run-off parliamentary election win by the moderate government of Iran is a crucial victory for them.", "id": "36180490"}

{"document": "Advertising plays a central role at Christmas, and for over 100 years has extended its reach from posters to radio, TV and now online.\nSuccessfully making that last leap has become the holy grail of Christmas advertising.\n\"The strategy among the retailers now is to get the ad into a prime time spot,\" says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research agency Conlumino.\n\"From then on TV becomes less important as the message goes off into social media, where there is less cost and the reach can be phenomenal, far greater than TV.\"\nSo, let's look at how that works with one of the most famous, the John Lewis ManOnTheMoon commercial.\nIn early November it launched the ad, telling the story of a small child who sees a lonely old man through a telescope living on the moon, and sends him a Christmas present by balloon.\nConventional wisdom might assume that the campaign should spark interest in the retailer - John Lewis - but there's barely a mention of the name.\nInstead the aim seems to be to spark interest in the ad itself.\nTo this end John Lewis actually advertised the advertisement with a 10 second teaser commercial a week before it went live, and fired up social media interest with the #ManOnTheMoon hashtag.\nThree hours after the advert was aired, #ManOnTheMoon was trending with 40,000 tweets.\nAnd it doesn't stop there. Of the Â£7m spent on the campaign, John Lewis spent only Â£1m on the ad itself, which is just the tip of a merchandising iceberg.\nThere's an app offering moon-related information. There's a tie-in with a game that can be played on mobiles, sending your presents to the moon by balloon, though at this point Christmas sentimentality is abandoned in favour of eluding surface to air missiles.\nThen there's a link-in with ManOnTheMoon telescopes, pyjamas, bedding, mugs and so on.\n\"The key to the John Lewis ad is that people no longer watch real-time television,\" says Jacques de Cock of the London School of Marketing.\n\"They defer their watching to Netflix or YouTube, and to capitalise on this market advertisers have to make their ads into social phenomena.\"\nThe reality is that companies are having to make contact with a customer whose habits are dictated not by TV but by the internet.\nFor instance, view the new Harvey Nichols commercial and the last frame has a \"Shop Now\" button to take you straight to the store.\nYou can't do that on TV.\nBut the customer is doing a lot more than just clicking and buying Uncle Cedric's Christmas socks on Amazon.\nHe or she is researching, comparing prices and browsing online, before either clicking or physically marching into the store and demanding the socks over the counter.\nAccording to Forrester Research, by 2020, 53% of retail sales across Europe will be influenced one way or another by the online world.\nSo it is not important to an advertiser by what mechanism the money is spent. What matters is where the customer makes up his or her mind - and that space is increasingly a digital one.\nAll of which shapes the way ads are made.\nSainsbury's advert \"Mog's Christmas Calamity\" written by the writer and illustrator Judith Kerr runs for a full three and a half minutes. The traditional TV ad break spot could never support that on a regular basis - but the internet can.\nLifting time restrictions allows for a great deal more creativity. For instance, the Mulberry Christmas commercial turns the gift of a red bag into a parody of the Nativity, attended by shepherds and Wise Men, which is witty both visually and verbally (\"It is a thing of wonder\" extols one of the Wise Men).\nAnd there are other opportunities to add nuances to your brand.\nClick on the end of the Sainsbury's commercial and up come links to Judith Kerr's book, the making of the commercial, Save the Children, competitions, recipes and of course Sainsbury's produce.\n\"We love working for retail,\" says James Murphy, chief executive of adam&eveDDB, which made the John Lewis ad.\n\"Retail is the new rock and roll in advertising. It is a great shop window for your creativity and for your effectiveness.\"\nSome might argue the industry is taking itself a teensy weensy bit too seriously. The Burberry Christmas commercial, borrowing its theme from the play/movie Billy Elliot, rolls its own credits at the end.\nBizarrely, the prize for the most viewed ad this Christmas goes to the German supermarket chain Edeka which has been shared 2.39 million times online, leaving John Lewis (1.3 million) and Sainsbury (917,000) trailing in its wake.\nIt tells a tear-jerking tale, that some might find in questionable taste, of an old man abandoned by his family at Christmas, until, by faking his own death he manages to bring them round the table for Christmas dinner.\nEdeka doesn't have an international retail operation. Yet the ad appears on YouTube with English subtitles, suggesting the commercial is as interested in its own brilliance as it is in trying to sell a product.\nSupermarket chain Aldi tried to puncture this sort of self-indulgence by making a parody of John Lewis's ManOnTheMoon ad with the frail old gentleman debating whether he should buy a cheaper telescope at Aldi.\nBut it raises the question - does any of this actually increase sales?\nMarks and Spencer tried to tap into this market in 2014, with its Magic and Sparkle TV commercial showing fairies carrying out gratuitous acts of generosity.\nThe fairies gathered 42,000 Twitter followers and the campaign was hailed as the most imaginative social media event of the year.\nBut it didn't work in terms of sales and Christmas turnover slumped.\n\"The campaign is only successful if you have the right product at the right price,\" says Neil Saunders.\n\"People may want to come to the shop, but if they can't find what they want they won't buy.\"\nThis year M&S has avoided story-telling and instead opted for what is little more than a glitzy montage of its wares.\nHowever, Robert Jones head of new thinking at agency Wolff Olins argues the campaign was still effective.\n\"It may not have worked in terms of Christmas sales - but this is part of a long term strategy to create an image. You can't change the way people see you in a single year.\"\nSo is the John Lewis ad working?\nOn the big discount day, Black Friday, sales were up 4.8% on last year. But it is worth noting that whatever the long term effect, the only John Lewis item featured in the ad - a telescope - had sold out online five hours after the ad went live.", "summary": "The internet is reinventing the Christmas TV commercial, making it more creative, more ambitious - and arguably more self-regarding.", "id": "34745809"}

He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things \"in perspective\".\nTillerson had previously said the US should \"maintain its seat at the table\" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement.\nBut publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal.

{"document": "Two bugging scandals, a very bitter row over drivers' penalty points and his failure to complete a breathalyser test at a police checkpoint have kept him in the headlines.\nBut they are just some of the disputes he was involved in.\nThe minister came to power with the Fine Gael/Labour coalition in February 2011, four months after the Republic of Ireland was forced to accept a humiliating international financial bail-out.\nMr Shatter, a lawyer, was put in charge of two government departments - justice and defence.\nAs the Republic of Ireland introduced painful austerity measures, the new justice minister set out on a wide-ranging reform agenda, which included plans to close more than 100 police stations.\nBut, in May 2013, the justice minister became embroiled in a public row that generated so much attention it became popularly known as Shattergate.\nThe minister was taking part in a TV debate about alleged police corruption in the penalty points system, following claims officers inappropriately wiped points from the driving licences of often well-connected offenders.\nHis opponent in the debate was the independent parliamentarian Mick Wallace who had made claims that sports stars, journalists and others appeared to have their driving penalties waived.\nMr Shatter accused his opponent of hypocrisy. He informed viewers that Mr Wallace had himself benefited from police discretion on a penalty points offence, having been observed using his mobile phone at a set of traffic lights in Dublin.\nThere was no formal reprimand or police record of the event, so Mr Wallace wanted to know how the minister could have known about it.\nMr Shatter said his information source was the then police chief, Martin Callinan, resulting in more questions over the minister's close working relationship with the country's top police officer - not for the first nor last time.\nWithin days, the justice minister faced questions in parliament about claims he had once failed to provide an alcohol breath test at a police road checkpoint in Dublin.\nIn a written statement, Mr Shatter replied that he failed to complete the breathalyser test because of his asthmatic condition and was waved on by officers.\nHe denied he had taken alcohol before getting into his car and said he was returning home from the Irish parliament.\nUnder Irish law, elected members going about parliamentary business cannot be arrested.\nHowever, Mr Shatter was then accused of abusing parliamentary privilege in refusing to submit to the breath test.\nThe country's main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, tabled a motion of no confidence in the justice minister, but it was defeated on 29 May 2013.\nIn December 2013,  Mr Shatter issued an unreserved apology on behalf of the state after a major public inquiry found that Irish police officers had colluded in the IRA murders of two senior Northern Ireland policemen in 1989.\nThe Smithwick Tribunal investigated allegations of collusion by the country's police force, An Garda Síochána, in the killings of Royal Ulster Constabulary officers, Supt Bob Buchanan and Ch Supt Harry Breen.\nThe RUC officers were shot dead by the IRA as they returned from a meeting at Dundalk Garda station.\nThe tribunal, and indeed the murders, had preceded Mr Shatter's tenure as justice minister by many years, but he was still caught up in controversy.\nIn June 2011, tribunal chairman Judge Peter Smithwick accused the minister of trying to interfere with the independence of the public inquiry.\nThe judge, opposition politicians and unionist representatives at Stormont objected to Mr Shatter's attempt to impose deadlines on the only Troubles-related public inquiry to take place in the Republic of Ireland.\nThe justice minister has also had a tense relationship with the Garda Representative Association (GRA), which represents rank and file police officers.\nIn 2013, the GRA passed a motion of no confidence in Mr Shatter and refused to invite him to address its annual conference.\nIt was the first time in the GRA's history that the organisation snubbed an Irish justice minister in such a way.\nOver recent months, Mr Shatter has been heavily criticised for his handling of claims that the office of the Irish police watchdog may have been bugged.\nA security sweep of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission's (GSOC) offices suggested evidence of electronic surveillance in a meeting room and a compromised wi-fi system.\nThe sweep was carried out last year, but details emerged months later in a Sunday Times newspaper report.\nIt also emerged that GSOC had not informed either the police or the justice minister about the findings of the security operation.\nMr Shatter publicly criticised the ombudsman for not informing him, but the opposition accused the minister of treating GSOC as the villain, not the victim, of the bugging controversy.\nMeanwhile, the actions of two police whistleblowers, who made allegations that there was widespread abuse of the penalty points system, were described as \"disgusting\" by Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan.\nWhen an independent report largely vindicated the whistleblowers, there were calls for the police chief to retract his \"disgusting\" remarks.\nMr Callinan refused to back down and weathered the criticism for three months. But on 25 March, he resigned unexpectedly.\nWithin hours, the timing of his resignation became clear as a new controversy engulfed both the police and the department of justice.\nThe government announced it was setting up an inquiry into revelations that telephone calls to and from many police stations had been secretly recorded, without the knowledge of either officers or callers.\nIt later emerged there were about 2,500 secret tapes still in existence, some dating from as far back as the 1980s.\nWitnesses in criminal investigations are among those whose conversations were secretly recorded and the revelations could have major implications for current and completed court cases.\nOpposition politicians repeated their calls for Mr Shatter to step down, but on 2 April, a second motion of no confidence was defeated in parliament by 95 votes to 51.\nThis week, the penalty points row and the Garda whistleblowers controversy came back to bite the minister.\nOn Tuesday, Data Protection Commissioner Billy Hawkes ruled that Mr Shatter had broken data protection laws during his TV spat with Mick Wallace.\nThe commissioner ruled the minister should not have disclosed personal information about Mr Wallace, namely telling viewers that the independent TD had been cautioned by police for using his mobile phone while driving.\nBut it was Mr Shatter's handling of the whistleblowers' case that finally caused his downfall.\nOn Wednesday, Taoiseach Enda Kenny told a stunned parliament that Mr Shatter had resigned following the government's receipt of a report into allegations made by Sgt Maurice McCabe.\nMr Kenny said his colleague had taken responsibility after the report criticised a number of agencies, including the police, the Department of Justice and the minister himself.\nHowever, the man who has been dubbed the \"minister for self-defence\" did not leave without a parting shot.\nIn his resignation letter, Mr Shatter said he disputed some aspects of the report.  He added that he \"would have expected\" the author Sean Guerin SC to interview him before reaching a conclusion.\nThe whistleblowers' report is due to be published on Friday.", "summary": "During his three years as Irish Justice Minister Alan Shatter was never far from controversy.", "id": "26744572"}

{"document": "It's a type of battery called lithium-sulphur, which - in theory - could have five times the energy density of the lithium-ion forms in wide use today.\nBut the prototype developed by a UK-Chinese team overcomes a key hurdle to their commercial development by taking inspiration from the gut.\nDetails appear in the journal Advanced Functional Materials.\nScientists are tackling the challenge of improving battery technology using a variety of different approaches; this is one of them.\nOne of the problems hindering the commercial development of lithium-sulphur-based devices has been the degradation of the batteries caused by the loss of active materials within.\nTo overcome this problem, the researchers developed a lightweight layer with nano-scale structure which resembles the villi - finger-like protrusions which line the small intestine.\nIn humans, villi are used to absorb the products of digestion and increase the surface area across which this process can take place.\nIn the new lithium-sulphur battery, a layer of material with a villi-like structure, made from tiny zinc oxide wires, is placed on the surface of one of the battery's electrodes.\nThis can trap fragments of the active material when they break off, keeping them accessible for ongoing reactions and allowing the material to be reused.\n\"It's a tiny thing, this layer, but it's important,\" said study co-author Dr Paul Coxon from the University of Cambridge's department of materials science and metallurgy.\n\"This gets us a long way through the bottleneck which is preventing the development of better batteries.\"\nThe researchers say that, if hurdles to commercial development can be overcome, lithium-sulphur batteries could have five times the energy density of the lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and other electronics.\nBut as lithium-sulphur batteries discharge, sulphur molecules transform into chain-like structures known as poly-sulphides.\nAs the devices undergo several charge-discharge cycles, bits of the poly-sulphide go into the battery's electrolyte (the electrically-conducting solution), so that over time the battery loses active material.\n\"This is the first time a chemically functional layer with a well-organised nano-architecture has been proposed to trap and reuse the dissolved active materials during battery charging and discharging,\" said lead author Teng Zhao, a PhD student from Cambridge.\n\"By taking our inspiration from the natural world, we were able to come up with a solution that we hope will accelerate the development of next-generation batteries.\"\nThe device is currently a proof of principle; commercially-available lithium-sulphur batteries are still some years away.\nAdditionally, while the number of times the battery can be charged and discharged has been improved, it is still not able to go through as many charge cycles as a lithium-ion battery.\nBut the researchers point out that, given a lithium-sulphur battery does not need to be charged as often as a lithium-ion battery, it may be the case that the increase in energy density cancels out the lower total number of charge-discharge cycles.", "summary": "Scientists have designed a new prototype battery that mimics the structure of the human intestines.", "id": "37788436"}

{"document": "Brandon Flowers invites the BBC into his bedroom.\nIt's an unusual start to our interview - but a camera crew is setting up in the living room of his rented London apartment.\nHe checks his hair in the mirror (\"a few grey hairs now\") and settles on the edge of the pristine white bed to talk about his new record, The Desired Effect.\nThe singer has been in the limelight for more than a decade now, as the frontman of stadium rock superheroes The Killers.\nBut despite his onstage swagger, the 33-year-old is softly-spoken and full of nervous energy, with a tendency to giggle after he speaks.\nHe confesses he'd rather be promoting this new record with his bandmates.\n\"I'm the singer in The Killers. That's what I am,\" he says.\n\"That's a big part of my identity. And I do wish that we were all here. That's the dream - a band of brothers going out to take on the world.\"\nThe Desired Effect is Flowers' second solo album - the rest of The Killers are unable, or unwilling, to keep up with his prodigious work rate.\nWhile its predecessor (2010's Flamingo) seemed like an extension of his day job, this record veers towards the melodramatic pop of the late 80s, full of orchestra hits and Phil Collins drum sounds.\nLead single Can't Deny My Love could easily fit on the soundtrack to St Elmo's Fire. And, when it appeared online in March, the response was unanimous: \"This is the record we've been waiting for Brandon Flowers to make for years\".\n\"Right when I started doing interviews, I realised I'd made The Killers' second record,\" he laughs.\n\"I mean, I made what we were supposed to do on our second album, but we never gave anybody that pleasure. We threw everyone a little bit with Sam's Town.\"\nDid he know that people wanted him to be a pop star?\n\"No,\" he replies. \"Sometimes you want to be more macho and you want the word 'rock' next to your name. But I'm not ashamed of it or anything. I love pop music. And I definitely have a knack for it.\"\nFlowers spent a year recording the album in Las Vegas and Los Angeles with producer Ariel Rechtshaid (Haim, Vampire Weekend).\nStaying true to the 1980s vibe, they enlisted Bruce Hornsby to play piano, and called in a guest appearance from Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant - who delivers a typically laconic line on the Bronski Beat-sampling I Can Change.\n\"I just texted Neil with the line and within minutes I got a voice memo,\" Flowers says.\n\"We just stuck it right on the computer. It's cool. Incredible. He didn't even hear the song or the tempo or anything. It just worked.\"\nBut the sessions weren't entirely smooth.\n\"Ariel had a big job, because he's used to going in with people who are just starting out,\" Flowers explains diplomatically.\n\"I always have a lot of ideas and my demos have a really strong identity. So he had to take it and bring it into his world and pray that we both liked it.\n\"Sometimes he maybe went a little bit too far.\"\nRechtshaid was nearly fired \"four times\", says the singer, \"but it was mostly over scheduling. He's a sought after guy right now, and I want all the attention!\"\nFlowers grew up in America's Southwest. The youngest of six children, he was born in Las Vegas and moved to Utah aged eight when his father became a Mormon.\nHis elder brother educated him in music, giving him cassettes of British indie bands like New Order and The Cure; and aged 16 he moved back to Las Vegas to live with an aunt, playing keyboards in a group called Blush Response while working as a bellhop.\nWhen the band abandoned him and moved to LA, he stayed behind, answering an advert placed in a local paper by guitarist Dave Keuning.\nInspired by an Oasis gig, they decided to form a group that placed as much emphasis on guitar as the synthesizer. Naming themselves The Killers after a fictional band in a New Order video, they wrote Mr Brightside almost immediately - propelling them to international stardom.\nIt was a big change for the frontman, whose previous ambition had been to get a job as a car valet.\n\"That was the top of the ladder,\" he laughs. \"I was working in restaurants and I was a bellman at a hotel and I worked on a golf course. I loved working for tips. It was exciting. And the upper echelon, the top shelf of that in Las Vegas is the valet parkers. They make a lot of money.\"\nHe's still connected to that world - writing songs about life on the breadline and the struggle to keep love alive in hard times.\nThose fears are crystallised on the track Between Me and You, where Flowers observes a fractured home life, singing:  \"chasing every dollar - is that what I was born to do?\"\n\"I really wanted to represent men in this song, and the pressure that is placed on you to provide and lead your family,\" he says.\n\"I don't have to worry about that - but I'm definitely not far removed from people that do.\"\n\"So I'm speaking about problems I see with people that are around me. I try to take it all in, then you squeeze the sponge and the song comes out.\"\nFlowers says the general theme of The Desired Effect is \"growing up\" after a decade on the road.\nHe gave up alcohol nearly eight years ago after recommitting to Mormonism, and spends his days off raising his three young children - cooking barbeques in the back garden and doing the school run.\n\"I'm a late bloomer but I'm definitely an adult now,\" he says. \"It takes a while.\"\nWhat does he make of Bono's assertion that rock stars remain frozen at the age they became famous?\n\"I think it can be a wonderful thing - being young at heart and all of that - but it can also be terrible,\" he muses.\n\"You meet people you assume are full-blown grown ups but they've been millionaires since they were 19 because they're in big bands and they act like they're 19. I've witnessed that and I don't want to be like that. I hope that I have grown.\"\n\"I'm happy.

{"document": "There is a 19km (12 mile), two-lane dual carriage motorway that links Ghana's capital Accra to the port city of Tema.\nThis road also happens to be the one I need to take to get me out of Accra on the way to my village.\nWhen the motorway was opened in 1965 and for years afterwards, it was the pride and joy of the nation.\nBack in 2008, a survey showed that an average of 65,200 vehicles travelled on the road each day and I am certain this number has since doubled.\nLast month, a part of the road collapsed and it has been total chaos.\nIt is fair to say that this did not come to anybody as a surprise - everybody saw it coming, there have been complaints on the radio, but there was no money to make proper repairs or undertake regular maintenance, or so we were told.\nEmergency works, which we are told will take 21 days to complete, are in progress. I am sure it will cost more than the money we did not have to do the regular repairs.\nThere is a suspension bridge over the Volta River at Adomi which links the eastern part of Ghana to the rest of the country.\nI also need to use this bridge to get me to my village. The bridge was built in 1956 and when I was young I used to find it awe-inspiring. It has an arch that spans about 805 feet (245 metres) and rises to about 219 feet at its crown.\nBack in 2008, the bridge had to be closed for several hours every day over a six-month period for emergency repair works to be done.  It was said at the time that no repairs had been done on the bridge since it was built.\nIn 2011, there was an announcement that the bridge would be closed for a year for major repairs. Nothing happened.\nLast April, a similar announcement was made and the scheduled closure dates went by without any word.\nThe bridge was closed last month and it will stay closed for two years for major repairs. I have no idea of the cost but I have no doubt we are paying emergency rates.\nAnd this attitude can be seen elsewhere, too.\nIf you see a house being painted anywhere in Ghana, you can safely assume that someone has died and there is a funeral coming up in that house.\nIf you are seen painting your house, people will stop by and ask if you have a funeral.\nRegular maintenance of structures is not one of our strong points. It is a subject much beloved of newspaper editors and government officials.\nThere are regular editorials and speeches bemoaning this lack of a maintenance culture. We can never find any money to paint or do any regular maintenance but when someone dies we find the money.\nIndeed, part of the reason Ghanaians keep dead bodies in the morgue for so long before burying them is because we have to paint the house or sometimes build a brand new one to be able to give a befitting send-off to the dearly departed. We prefer the emergency rates.\nBut maybe I should stop moaning about the funerals. After all, a death in every house means every house gets painted.\nThere are many homes in villages around the country where the electricity has been disconnected because there is no money to pay the fees - once there is a death, the bill will be paid, complete with the reconnection fee and all other penalty charges.\nOnce the bridge is about to collapse we shall find the money.

More than 50,000 hip and 70,000 knee, replacements take place in the UK each year.\nWhile they can last for decades, some fail within years. This can happen when the bone around the implant is dissolved by the body meaning the replacement joint becomes loose.\nThe theory was that bisphosphonates, which are used by patients with osteoporosis to prevent bone being broken down, would prevent the loosening.\nThe researchers looked at data from General Practice Research Database for joint replacements and compared what happened to 1,912 patients taking bisphosphonates with 41,995 patients who did not.\nAfter five years, 1.96% of implants failed without the drug, compared with 0.93% in those taking medication.\nProf Nigel Arden, a specialist in rheumatic diseases at the Universities of Oxford and Southampton, said the first implant would cost the NHS about Â£7,000, but replacements would cost Â£34,000.\nHe told the BBC: \"It has the potential to have a huge impact.\"\nHe said two of the risk factors, age and obesity, meant the number of cases was \"increasing dramatically\".\nProf Arden is not arguing that people should be given the drug yet.

You've got to find the resources, the facilities and the people,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for firearms, said last month that the majority of new armed officers will be in place by April 2017.\nThe latest announcement comes after 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice in the south of France last month.\nLondoners and tourists out enjoying the August sunshine in central London report mixed feelings about more armed police patrolling the city's streets.\nTeacher Julie Banks, who was visiting from Liverpool, says she finds the news reassuring, \"especially at this time of year when there are more tourists and crowds. We shouldn't be complacent\".\nRetired friends John Lee and John Coles, both from London, agree. \"It's a good thing. It's not going to stop a terror attack, but it makes people feel more secure,\" Mr Coles says.\n\"I never thought I would see the day British police carried weapons in the street like this, but I think that needs to happen now - whether we like it or not,\" Mr Lee adds.\nBricklayer Gary Johns, 34, approved, but says: \"The real question is what their response time is.\"\nOthers, however, say the sight of police carrying heavy weapons makes them uneasy. \"It makes me more nervous than secure to be honest,\" says Bryony Wood, a make-up artist, 26, from west London. \"It's a reminder of what might happen.\"\n\"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says Ebuka Orunta, 20, from south London. \"On one hand I feel safer knowing the Met has a strategy in place to mitigate the risk.\n\"On the other hand, we've seen the problems with police brutality in the US. It's important the people in charge of this weaponry are the right people who are going to protect us.\"\nSir Bernard said: \"We have no intelligence that there will be an attack shortly but what we do know is what we have seen in western Europe.\n\"We have seen attacks in Germany, in Belgium, in France and we would be foolish to ignore that, so it's important that we get officers out there with firearms to respond.\"\nThe commissioner said the increased firearms teams would be patrolling randomly around the clock.\nIt comes after he told a newspaper that a terror attack on the UK is highly likely and a case of \"when, not if\". Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Met chief said there was a \"sense of fear\" in Britain.\nMr Khan said: \"It's really important that Londoners are reassured that the police service, that the security service, that all of us are doing our bit to keep Londoners in our city safe...\n\"The threat level hasn't changed but we are learning the lessons from Europe, from Nice, from Paris, from Munich.\"\nBy BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani\nThe Metropolitan Police have long aimed to make the capital as \"hostile\" an environment as possible for any would-be attacker to carry out a mass-casualty attack.\nBut if they can't stop someone attacking, the goal is to have enough armed police available to get to the scene of an atrocity quickly to minimise casualties and neutralise the threat.\nArmed police reached the scene of the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby 11 minutes after the 999 call. The attackers were not armed with automatic weapons and just stood there waiting for police to arrive, rather than attacking anyone else.\nClearly, in a Paris-style scenario, 11 minutes is a long, long time so a great deal of today's security planning aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers could reach a scene.\nNone of which addresses a much bigger issue: what if the attack isn't in London, Birmingham or Manchester? Major cities may be well-resourced - but preparing to respond to an incident elsewhere is far more challenging.\nThe Met said the new armed officers would be \"working alongside their neighbourhood and specialist colleagues\", and Mr Khan said there would be a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year.\nIn Munich, Germany, nine people died in a shooting at a shopping centre in July while in November 2015, gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris.\nMeanwhile, Mr White expressed his concern about the time it would take to put the plan in place.\n\"What we've got to make sure is that we have the resources in the right place at the right time and we've also got to recognise that this isn't London-centric... a terrorist attack could happen anywhere in the country.\"\nFirearms officers in the Metropolitan Police have to undergo a comprehensive selection and training process before they are allowed on to the streets with a gun.", "summary": "More armed police are to be seen on patrol in London, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan have said.", "id": "36961338"}
{"document": "Yet while such a prospect would make most of us run a mile, this is in fact a traditional massage method in Russia.\nCalled a \"venik\" massage, the oak bunches are first softened in warm water. And rather than being whacked on your back in anger, they are gently and rhythmically applied.\nIt is a popular treatment in the thousands of steam bathhouses, or \"banyas\", across Russia.\nThe massage, which takes place in a sauna room set at a temperature of 70C, is said to boost circulation and prevent premature ageing of the skin.\nAnd after the treatment has finished you are supposed to immediately jump into a plunge pool of cold water.\nYou might think that such an unusual massage would struggle to be successfully exported from Russia, but the co-founder of the first banya in London says that two years after opening, almost half of its customers are non-Russians.\nLaunching the banya, called Banya No.1, was the dream of entrepreneurial Russian ex-pat Ksenia Bobkova.\nThe 37-year-old has lived in the UK for more than 20 years after moving from St Petersburg to study law at Edinburgh University in 1994.\nAfter graduating from Edinburgh she has had a successful career in finance in London, first working at a large commercial law firm, and then co-founding a new investment company.\nYet as much as Ms Bobkova says she has always enjoyed living in the UK, the one thing she really missed was regular trips to a banya.\nAfter dreaming of opening London's first banya for more than a decade, Ms Bobkova says that in 2012 \"the circumstances came together\" to enable her to finally start work on it.\nFirstly, she realised that more and more Russians were now living in London, which she hoped would make a banya commercially viable, and she had built up enough savings to launch the business.\nThen she found the right building, and two other UK-based Russian investors came on board.\nAfter a year of construction work, including importing a traditional banya stove from Russia, the bathhouse opened its doors in 2013.\n\"When we wrote the business plan, we certainly focused on the fact that the Russian-speaking community in London had grown substantially over the past 15 years,\" she says.\n\"But after we opened we soon discovered that London is so international, and that people who live here are so open to new experiences, that almost half our customers are non-Russian.\"\nCustomers - both male and female - who don't want to strip naked can instead wear their swimming costume, or a strategically placed towel. And for people who wish to avoid the oak leaves, Scandinavian-style, hands-based back massages are also available.\nAfter the massages, people are encouraged to stay and relax in a lounge or rest area, where they can order traditional Russian food.\nWhile Ms Bobkova is reluctant to discuss how financially successful the banya is, it is often full, and typical visits cost Â£100 per person. And she now plans to open more branches.\nRunning the banya is a world apart from Ms Bobkova's main job of helping to lead investment firm Fusion Asset Management, of which she was a founding partner in 2004.\nThe business invests millions of pounds globally on behalf of large institutions, and has a sister office in Moscow.\nWhile the original six founders included one Englishman, an American and a Frenchman, it is now owned and run by three London-based Russian ex-pats.\nMs Bobkova says that she likes working in the UK, because she values what she describes as \"British fair play\" in business.\n\"Without comparing specifically to Russia, what is very fundamental in British business ethics is this concept of fair play,\" she says.\n\"[Doing business in the UK means] you can trust people, and people will generally not try to squeeze you too much. In the UK both sides get a fairly allocated share of the profit, rather than one gets all, and the other gets nothing.\"\nIn terms of her day-to-day style as a boss she says that while she has high expectations of staff, it is a point of principle that the 20 people at the finance firm don't have to work late nights or at weekends.\n\"Nothing in the world is so important that it needs to be done at the weekend,\" she says.\nIn addition to the two businesses, Ms Bobkova is also a co-founder of a networking organisation for Russians living and working in London.\nCalled Russians in the City, and with 2,300 members, it holds quarterly events, such as drinks parties, or polo matches and skiing trips.\nThe world is getting wealthier - but with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, who are the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015?\nA Richer World 2015\nListen to the reports and documentaries\nThe organisation has since opened a sister branch in Switzerland, with other ones due to open in New York and Dubai.\nA UK passport holder, and previously married to a British husband, Ms Bobkova says that Russians in the City allow her to maintain the Russian side of her identity.\n\"I'm British in that I have lived here for 20 years, but I'm also obviously Russian,\" she says.\n\"There are different categories of immigrants. Some are so integrated that they almost deny where they came from, while at the other end, some people don't integrate at all.\n\"I'm somewhere in the middle, I'm fully integrated, I went to a British university... I speak English.... but I also like my Russian heritage, which I nurture through the bathhouse and through the network.\"", "summary": "As leisure activities go, you would imagine that lying naked on a wooden table while two topless Russian men hit your back with bunches of oak leaves would only appeal to a very specialist group of enthusiasts.", "id": "31921778"}

Those strong people make really good board members because they have strong views and they're not afraid to think differently than other people, which has served Facebook well.\"\nBut one expert questioned whether the decision to keep on Mr Thiel  - who was one of Facebook's early investors - was sustainable in the long-term.\n\"Facebook has always fundamentally seen itself as a technology company, but is now having to deal with the public position - and also the ethics and responsibilities - of being a publisher,\" media consultant Steve Hewlett told the BBC.\n\"Imagine that this person were sitting on the board of The Times or the BBC - that would look like an obvious conflict of interest. You can't have a billionaire sitting on a publisher's board who is suing other people for publishing things.\n\"So, if you think of Facebook as being a publisher, this is plainly problematic.\"\nThe clash between Gawker and Mr Thiel dates back to 2007, when the media firm published an article headlined: \"Peter Thiel is totally gay people\".\nLast week, the venture capitalist revealed to the New York Times that he had subsequently funded a team of lawyers to find and help \"victims\" of other Gawker articles sue the firm - an act he described as \"philanthropic\".\nOne case resulted in a jury ordering Gawker to pay Hulk Hogan $140m (Â£97m) after it decided the publication of a sex tape featuring the ex-professional wrestler amounted to an invasion of privacy.\nGawker is appealing against the ruling, which threatens its future.\nThe publisher has also challenged Mr Thiel's involvement and questioned his continued role at the social network.\n\"As a Facebook board member, how have your own views on politics and news influenced your contribution to corporate decisions?\" asked Gawker's founder Nick Denton in an open letter.\nJeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post newspaper, was critical of Mr Thiel earlier in the week during his own appearance at the Code Conference.\n\"I don't think a billionaire should be able to fund a lawsuit to kill Gawker,\" he said.\n\"Seek revenge and you dig two graves.

{"document": "The study measured poisonous nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels using 40 sensors in and around the airport.\nIt then used modelling to predict what would happen in the future.\nHowever, the Aviation Environment Federation (AEF) said the research was \"highly speculative\" and there was no guarantee pollution levels would fall.\nMinisters will decide within weeks whether to enlarge Heathrow or rival Gatwick and the environmental impact will play a big part in that decision.\nThe work was led by the University of Cambridge and has no formal links to any airport or the government.\nProf Rod Jones from the University of Cambridge told the BBC: \"If there is the development of a third runway, we expect there to be a marginal increase in NO2 coming from the airport itself, but that would be against the background of reduced NO2 from other traffic, because of Euro 6 engines and electrification of the traffic fleet.\"\nIn other words, it comes down to traffic on the roads, rather than planes in the air, because that is where the bulk of the poisonous nitrogen dioxide gases come from.\nAs new, cleaner car, lorry and bus engines become more common, pollution levels should decline, wiping out any increase from a bigger Heathrow.\nHowever, Cait Hewitt, deputy director of the AEF, said that the plan was for the third runway to be operational by the 2020s.\n\"The assumption would have to be that over the next decade, we'd move from having something like 57% of London's vehicles fleet being diesel vehicles to instead having ultra-clean electric vehicles throughout the capital. There just isn't evidence to suggest that's going to happen,\" said Ms Hewitt.\nProf Jones said using lots of smaller sensors, dotted in hard to reach places, gave them a clearer picture of what was going on.\n\"By deploying a network of sensors we can tell directly from the measurements, what's been emitted locally from Heathrow airport and what's been blown in, mostly from central London. That's the real strength of the sensor network,\" he said.\n\"The major result from this study is that we have tested the models far more critically than you can from a single measurement site.\"\nCurrently, the air has climbed above European health limits at several sites near Heathrow. This work suggests that as cleaner engines kick in levels will fall again.\nIt is a conclusion that tallies broadly with previous research for the government, but that research relied on estimates, whereas this latest work used more accurate, real-world measurements.\nOpponents think air quality is the Achilles heel for Heathrow expansion and could be where it is challenged in the courts. That is what happened the last time they wanted to build a third runway.\nKeith Taylor, who is a member of the European Parliament's Transport committee and the Green MEP for the South East of England, told the BBC:\n\"It is entirely speculative to suggest that any assumed reduction in traffic pollution will offset airport expansion.\n\"The air pollution crisis in the UK responsible for the deaths of an estimated 50,000 people every year, a responsible government would not entertain the idea of endorsing a project that, as the report makes clear, will increase the toxicity of the air we all breathe.\n\"We need to be striving for the lowest emissions possible, not try to squeak in just under the European targets, by relying on over-optimistic traffic predictions. The right number of new runways is zero\".\nAirport expansion has been shoved under a carpet in Downing Street for decades, but now the Conservatives say they want to get on with it.\nThe current \"hot date\" for a decision is 18 October, but it could change.\nPicking Heathrow would put the cat among the pigeons, because a number of high-profile ministers, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Education Secretary Justine Greening, are against the scheme. Chancellor Phillip Hammond has also favoured Gatwick in the past.\nPrime Minister Theresa May could give her MPs a free vote on the issue to avoid anyone having to resign.\nInterestingly, Mrs May's constituency sits under the flight-path but it's hard to find her openly opposing expansion. Opponents at the Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise managed to dig out this from her website on May 2010, when the coalition came in and cancelled Labour's third runway scheme. It's not on the website now, they had to use a special archiving service to find it.\nMs May said at the time: \"Like many local residents, I strongly welcome [the] cancellation of the third runway at Heathrow. Expanding Heathrow in this way would have had a detrimental effect on the Maidenhead and Twyford areas by increasing levels of noise and pollution, and today's announcement is a victory for all those who have campaigned against it.\"\nHer predecessor David Cameron painted himself into a corner over the issue in the run-up to the 2010 election, when he said he would never expand Heathrow if he became PM.\nMinisters still have three options: a third runway at Heathrow, a second at Gatwick, or a third scheme that would double the length of one of Heathrow's existing runways.\nThis latest, million-pound research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and alongside Cambridge, experts from the universities of Manchester and Hertfordshire, Imperial College London, CERC Limited and the National Physical Laboratory were involved.\nHeathrow helped them put the sensors up and British Airways provided some flight data, but neither handed over any money or were involved in the actual work.\nLast December, the government told the BBC it had to go away and double-check a few things before making a decision, claiming it was \"subject to further consideration on environmental impacts and the best possible mitigation measures\".\nI have asked, but they won't tell me what they've been checking for nigh on a year. And I'm not the only one.\nRavi Govindia, leader of Wandsworth Council, told the BBC: \"We have repeatedly asked for information on the government's latest investigation in airport expansion, but they seem to be operating in secret.\n\"Our concern is that Heathrow is being consulted on this work while communities surrounding the airport are kept in the dark. Years of detailed analysis have shown that expanding this airport is unlawful and undeliverable.\"\nMr Govindia, and plenty of other opponents, argue there's a plane-load of good reasons to biff the Heathrow plan. This study concentrated on NO2, but there are lots of other nasties in the air, then there's the noise, local congestion, cost to the taxpayer from rebuilding the roads, possible air fare rises to pay for it all, and so on and so on.\nEven if the government does make a \"quick\" decision, that is just the start of it. Labour backed Heathrow expansion in 2008, but the plan was ditched by the incoming coalition government.\nWhichever scheme they pick will meet loud, angry resistance.\nMeanwhile in Montreal, the airline industry is inching towards what would be a historic first global deal to curb greenhouse gases. The International Civil Aviation Authority is being asked to agree for the first time that the rise in emissions from aircraft is mostly capped from 2020.\nAircraft would be made more efficient and any extra emissions would be offset by, say, planting trees.

In Scotland, the proportion of time spent teaching was even higher, more than 200 hours above average.\nThe report also shows that teachers' pay in England has had an above-average decline in real terms, between 2005 and 2013.\nDespite the recession, countries such as Poland, Germany, the United States and Australia had increased teachers' pay in real terms.\nBut in England, based on an analysis of secondary school teachers, pay had fallen, with only countries such as Greece and Portugal having a more substantial decline.\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said the report recognised \"above average funding\" for education in England.\n\"Great teachers are at the heart of this government's commitment to delivering educational excellence everywhere,\" he said.\n\"This is why we are not only tackling excessive teacher workload but have also given head teachers the freedom to pay good teachers more, meaning the best teachers can access greater rewards earlier in their careers.\"\nBut John Bangs, of Education International, an international federation of teachers' unions, said the OECD report showed that the \"teachers' pay freeze is damaging education across many countries and that includes England\".\n\"The best potential teachers are finding jobs in other, better paid professions,\" he said.\n\"The message on class size is also clear.\n\"In larger classes, teachers are spending more time on classroom control and less time on teaching.\n\"We also know that larger classes lead to teacher burnout and teacher shortage.\"\nThe study showed the high cost of university in England - with high levels of fees, high levels of student finance and high levels of expenditure per student.\nThe report shows a comparison of fees in public institutions - with England charging the highest fees in the world.\nBut this does not include private universities, such as many of the most prestigious and most expensive universities in the US.\nSir Peter Lampl, chairman of the education charity Sutton Trust, said: \"These figures should cause the government to avoid steps that could hamper access, including replacing grants for poorer students with loans leaving them more indebted than richer students, cutting widening participation funding, or reducing the independence of the access regulator.\"\nThe study confirms the findings of previous reports, that despite increasing numbers of graduates, the advantage in earnings is not declining.\nOn average, graduate earnings are 60% above those who have not progressed beyond basic secondary school qualifications, equivalent to five good GCSEs.\nIn the UK, 71% of graduates are earning above the median salary.\nAs well as earning higher pay, this year's report says that graduates are much less likely to be unemployed. Graduates in the UK have among the lowest rates of unemployment among developed countries - only New Zealand has a lower proportion of unemployed graduates.\nAt the other end of the scale, based on figures for 2014, Greece and Spain have the highest rates of graduate unemployment.\nMr Schleicher said that the economic advantage for graduates showed the importance of fair access.\n\"Lack of a quality education is the most powerful form of social exclusion,\" said Mr Schleicher.", "summary": "Teachers in England and Scotland have more teaching hours and bigger primary classes than in most other developed countries, according to an OECD annual education report.", "id": "34902882"}

I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually.\nOn top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself.\nThe influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power.\nIn relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for £1m, why would there be another £1m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football.\nJonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group\nAgents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one.\nPeople get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter.\nHowever, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football.\nWe get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly.\nStoke City chairman Peter Coates\nFootball clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised.\nI wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5%, 10% or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get.\nThere are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it.

{"document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nIt began when he left behind a glamorous Manhattan lifestyle for the wonder and wastelands of Sierra Leone five years ago. It will end when he walks through the front door of the family home in Lisburn, Belfast for Christmas, having lived through an incredible time in modern history.\nVery few 29-year-olds have managed a national football team. None have done it while that country is being brought to its knees by Ebola. \"I'm very sad, very emotional,\" he said.\n\"Saying goodbye to Sierra Leone was very emotional, very difficult. I don't keep my distance from things; I invest emotionally. The country has become part of me.\"\nHaving been an academy coach with the New York Red Bulls, McKinstry was appointed technical director of the Craig Bellamy academy in Sierra Leone at the age of 24.\nBy 27, he was manager of the national team. Within 18 months his squad were in the top 50 of the world rankings for the first time. \"I've made a career of proving doubters wrong,\" he said.\nTwo months ago he was sacked by email, as the Ebola outbreak gathered momentum.\n\"We believed we had the chemistry, cohesion and spirit to achieve anything. But the Ebola outbreak changed everything. Circumstances meant that, in the end, it was an impossible job.\"\nMcKinstry stepped off a plane four hours before we met in a London hotel. He had not slept for the best part of two days.\nThe journey to Freetown Airport had to be made by boat to avoid some of the areas worst affected by Ebola. An early flight meant crossing the night before.\nA night at an airport, one plane to Morocco, another to London followed by a medical check by customs officers is no ordinary preparation for an interview. But for a man who has spent much of the past six months living in lockdown, being among the bustle again is a welcome change.\nHis time in Sierra Leone has now come to an end. The memory of it will, however, live on.\n\"In the last month or so when I went into Freetown for supplies, I started to see more of the Ebola response teams, with the full yellow bio-hazard suits,\" he said. \"You might see an ambulance driving past and even the driver would be in the full bio-hazard gear.\n\"When you see that it really does bring it home to you just how serious the situation is.\"\nMcKinstry was offered a way out, a safe passage home in July, but refused it. Many of the players in the academy were from affected areas, he felt he had a duty of care not to walk away and send the young footballers into danger.\nInstead he quarantined the academy behind the gate and walls of the compound. \"When the outbreak started a lot of people ran for cover,\" he said.\n\"But Ebola is a disease of contact, if you remove the contact, you remove the risk. So that is what we did. We moved everyone who was off site, behind the walls. We had generators for power, bore holes for fresh water, we had dorm rooms, classrooms and a football pitch.\"\nIn Northern Ireland his family were growing increasingly worried about the situation. Did they want him home? \"They wanted information. They wanted to know what was going on, to know that I was safe, that the boys at the academy were safe,\" he said.\nIt is not sensationalist to suggest that the Ebola virus cost McKinstry his job as head coach. But before he explained how it came to an end, he addressed the question of how it all began.\n\"When it comes to football, confidence has not been something I have been lacking,\" McKinstry said with a smile. \"There is a saying in Newcastle - 'shy bearns get nowt' - if you don't ask you don't get.\n\"That was my attitude to the Sierra Leone job. I know I was 27 but if they said no, nothing is lost. If they said yes, it was going to be the start of an exciting new chapter.\"\nMcKinstry had watched every Sierra Leone home game in person, every away game on TV, he had watched them train, studied their players. \"I thought I was the best man for the job,\" he added. \"I got in the room with the decision-makers and I went through Sierra Leone's last two games with a fine tooth comb and Tunisia's last two, who would be our next opponents.\n\"I outlined how I'd beat Tunisia, how I saw the future. Every member of the panel went away with a dossier, which I told them they could keep and use even if they didn't choose me.\n\"Two days later they offered me the job.\"\nMcKinstry made an impressive start, losing just one of his first six matches and leading Sierra Leone into the top 50 of Fifa's world rankings, above Northern Ireland, the Republic, Cameroon and Senegal. Then the Ebola outbreak happened and football became a side issue.\n\"We looked at what little we could do as sporting heroes, could we put smiles on the faces of the nation?\" McKinstry said. \"Football is a second religion in Sierra Leone.\n\"So when the national team wins, the national psyche is buoyed, everyone walks an inch or two taller. We made a commitment to keep on winning to try to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations so that people in the country would feel a little bit better. Unfortunately it wasn't to work out that way.\"\nThe Confederation of African Football ruled that Sierra Leone could not play games at home. A challenging task was becoming a near-impossible one. \"In football, the home team tends to win 50% of the time. In Africa, the home team wins 65 or 70% of the time,\" McKinstry explained.\nThat was not the only complication. \"In my final game, against DR Congo, we had 17,000 fans just chanting 'Ebola, Ebola, Ebola' at us. It was upsetting for our players. The atmosphere was difficult. It made the players angry that people were mocking the situation in their homeland,\" he said.\nSierra Leone players found opponents unwilling to shake hands, hotels unwilling to check them in and governments uncertain on granting them entry. \"People fear things they don't know,\" he said. \"Hotel arrangements were monitored wherever we went, there were daily medical checks for my players and, while that is not overly difficult, it can impact on players' mental state.\"\nSierra Leone's first group game as they attempted to qualify for the African Cup of Nations was away to Ivory Coast in early September.\nWith a week to go, McKinstry was still unsure whether he and his players would be allowed into the country. The confusion meant some players had to buy their own plane tickets. Others arrived the night before the game.\nSierra Leone led for an hour, only to lose 2-1. The demands of their schedule meant the squad left at 11pm that night to fly to DR Congo for a 'home' qualifier that was to be played in the away team's stadium. That game too ended in a 2-0 defeat and was marred by chants of 'Ebola, Ebola.'\nMcKinstry did not see the end coming. He said: \"I had been in the FA building that day and not once was anything mentioned. I was driving back home, over a mountain pass, when my phone buzzed with an email from one of the men I'd been speaking to, not two hours earlier. It said they had terminated my contract. I was disappointed. I'd been standing in their office a few hours earlier.\n\"But I believe in a certain way of doing things. So I spun the car around, went straight back to the FA, not to argue with them but just to go in shake hands and say 'best of luck for the future and it has been a pleasure for the past 18 months.'\"\nMcKinstry has a voracious appetite for football and for learning, he lives and breathes it and his sense of adventure means predicting his next move is not easy.\nIn the New Year he has a series of meetings in Asia. This is not a man who does things by the book. Having been a coach from the age of 15, McKinstry already has miles on the clock.\nThe boyhood Newcastle United fan still dreams of taking charge at St James' Park or leading his native Northern Ireland out. \"Nothing would make me prouder, my heart would be beating out of my chest for both those opportunities at some stage in my career.\"\nWatch the full interview with Johnny McKinstry - Football Focus, BBC One on Saturday 20 December at 12:10 GMT.", "summary": "Johnny McKinstry is on the final leg of a remarkable journey.", "id": "30472392"}

Any advice would be most welcome.\nAmanda\nHi Amanda,\nFirstly, congratulations to your daughter on what is a good set of AS results. With promising grades like these I certainly wouldn't suggest she gives up either!\nThe entry requirements for Durham University's English Literature BA course are certainly competitive: A*AA at A-level for 2017.\nIf she has her heart set on going there, I'd suggest she sits down to discuss the year ahead and the work she'll need to put in with her subject tutors, as well as having an informal chat on the phone with an admissions tutor if possible.\nRemember she has five options to apply for on her Ucas form, so researching some alternative unis and heading to a few open days will be worth doing to keep her options open. All the best in the year to come!\nAlex\nHi Amanda,\nThe the most important thing at the moment is to see how your daughter feels - after all, she is going to be the one doing the hard work.\nResitting the AS year is the most likely way of increasing her grade. She could certainly look at changing to a different school if she feels the quality of teaching or environment is the reason for her grades, but the downside would be having to adjust to new surroundings which could affect her studies.\nDurham University will look at her AS grades when considering any application but if her teachers have predicted that she can get the right grades then there's no real reason why she would not be able to achieve them.\nYou and your daughter could discuss her options with a National Careers Service adviser on 0800 100 900 or the Exams Results Helpline on 0800 100 8000.\nGood luck!\nTom.\nI've been on the phone most of the morning trying to appeal one of my grades because it's just on the border of me getting a A and I need it to get into my university.\nWe've been told the appeals process has changed this year, so wondering whether it'll all be done in time so I can actually go to uni in September? I don't want to have to wait another year as fees may go up again. Is there a time they must give re-marks back by?\nTom, Manchester\nHi Tom,\nGreat to hear you're already on the ball with getting in touch with the examining body to appeal your mark, speed is certainly of the essence! This will almost definitely be resolved before your September starting date but the sooner you act the better.\nThe deadline for re-mark enquiries is Friday 26 August for results which affect university places. The examining body appeals department is staffed by people who understand how important it is for you to get an answer as quickly as possible, so expect things to move fast.\nIf you haven't already spoken to your university, get in touch to explain the situation. They may accept you on to your chosen course with the grades you have; if not, they will at least be aware that you are very much still interested in taking your place.\nIt's worth remembering that this is certainly not the first time the university will have dealt with situations just like yours and they understand that it takes a while to get re-marks organised.\nI hope this helps.\nTom.\nHi Tom,\nSorry to hear you've been having a frustrating time of it today. If you're at school or college, your first port of call when it comes to appealing a grade needs to be with them. Students can't make enquiries directly with examining boards; your school needs to do this on your behalf.\nAs your university place depends on the outcome of this result, you'll be able to use the rapid appeals process (deadline next Friday).  I'd also suggest speaking directly with your university if you've not done so already, as depending on the number of places they have available, they may be willing to accept you with your current grades or hold your place open for longer.\nYou're right that the appeals process has changed this year. New rules means that essentially marks will only be changed if an examiner has made an error in applying the marking scheme or adding up the marks, rather than on the basis of a difference in academic judgement. Which? has produced a step-by-step guide to the process.\nGood luck,\nAlex.\nI found out this morning that I got into my first choice! Just wondered when I had to apply for accommodation and healthcare etc? Is there a deadline? Everywhere seems to be giving different information.\nGeorgia, Essex\nHi Georgia,\nWell done on getting into your chosen university. Now you definitely know where you're going, I'd suggest getting straight on with applying for accommodation if you haven't done so already, especially if you're hoping to stay in university halls of residence.\nNot every university will have guaranteed space available for all first years (though some do) so places will be getting snapped up fast. Of course, there are plenty of other options, including privately-run halls and student housing, so check in with your university's accommodation office.\nAs for healthcare, registering with a local or on-campus GP should definitely be on your freshers' week to-do list. Have a great time!\nAlex\nI would like to ask where to find apprenticeships and internships. I just finished a gap year abroad after achieving three A-levels in maths, electronics and German. I am really interested in doing an apprenticeship in electronic engineering.\nEverything at college was geared to university.  I hear that companies want more women in engineering but where do we look? A lot of them ask for top grades and companies are missing out on a lot of potential. During my gap year I moved to Germany for six months to work in a law firm.\nI really want to stay in England but I feel like I'm being pushed towards Germany as they focus on the many routes to finding a job.\nLiberty, West Sussex\nI'm sorry to hear you are finding it difficult to find apprenticeship and internship opportunities.\nIt is true that a lot of the companies offering higher and degree level apprenticeships are asking for applicants with high qualification grades, but the fact you have a variety of work experience should work well in your favour.\nMany companies consider applications for those who might not have the specific grades indicated but instead have knowledge and experience which is directly linked to the apprenticeship role advertised.\nIt can be difficult to find higher level apprenticeship positions to apply for as the market is very competitive but a good starting point is the National Apprenticeships Service website.\nAlso try Not Going to Uni and Tomorrow's Engineers  which offers apprenticeship opportunities in a range of technology and engineering fields.\nIf you are struggling, call the National Apprenticeship Helpdesk on 0800 150400 or the National Careers Service on 0800 100 900 to discuss the best ways to search for apprenticeship places. You will hopefully get some advice on apprenticeships similar to the advice you were able to get about universities while at college.\nI hope this helps and good luck!\nTom.\nWould a university accept you on a different subject during clearing than the one you were originally hoping to do when you wrote your Ucas form?\nMatt\nHi Matt,\nYes, it's certainly possible to opt for a different subject when you're applying for a course in clearing. In fact, when Which? surveyed students who went through clearing last year, about a fifth told us they had done just that.\nThink carefully about your choice though. Remember you've probably spent time researching your original subject area, so we wouldn't suggest venturing too far from that area of study. A joint honours degree could be worth considering.\nWhen speaking to a university, you'll need to be prepared to explain why you're committed to the course and subject they're offering and that you're clear on the specifics of what you'll be doing. All the best in your search.\nAlex\nHi Matt,\nYou are able to apply through clearing for any subject which has a vacancy, even if it is different from your original choice. It's always worth speaking with the university first to make sure they will consider you for this course however, as they will still be looking at your grades and what subjects you have studied.\nIt's a good idea to think about what new subject you are choosing and why, as it's easy to rush headlong into something that might not be best suited to you. If in doubt, speak to your teachers, parents or one of the careers advisers at the National Careers Service.\nTom\nMy daughter has the grades she needs to get into her university of choice to study marketing. Most of her friends are going on a gap year and now she has her grades and is feeling confident, she also wants to go abroad and spend time gaining work experience.\nWhat does she need to do, is it even allowed and who should she contact - Ucas or the university?\nKat, Bolton\nFirstly, congratulations to your daughter on a great set of results.\nYou don't mention whether the university place she is currently holding is for deferred entry already, but it sounds like that's not the case. If not, she needs to speak to her university as soon as possible to see if they would be happy for her to defer her confirmed place for 12 months so she can pursue her gap year.\nMost universities will be accommodating to a change of plan, particularly if she has good results and is intending to make good use of her year obtaining relevant work experience.\nThe university will then need to reflect this change on Ucas, which of course will then potentially free up that place for someone else to start this year. Best of luck!\nAlex.\nMy daughter did poorly in her AS results, getting a C and two Es.\nIt is realistic to hope that she will recover in one year to get Cs?\nClaire\nHi Claire,\nIt can certainly be realistic for your daughter to gain her C grades this time next year. A lot of students will have received grades which may be lower than expected at AS and still go on to achieve fantastic results in their A2 exams.\nMany students find the change from GCSE to A-level difficult. Ask your daughter how she feels about the results. If she was expecting better grades, is there a particular reason why she thinks the marks are lower? Does the way she has been learning suit her skills or has she been struggling?\nThe options open to your daughter are to continue to her second year and take the A-level exams, consider resits, or think about re-marks if she feels there has been a mistake.\nIt's best to discuss the last two options with her teachers as soon as possible. The deadline for re-mark requests is 20 September.\nIt may also be that your daughter isn't enjoying the environment she is in and this is affecting her studies. It may be worth looking at different qualifications types as well, as there might be something much more suited to your daughter's strengths available through college courses or apprenticeships.\nYou can call National Careers Service yourself on 0800 100 900 from 08:00 to 22:00 BST for the latest information.\nGood luck to you both!\nTom\nHi Claire,\nI think there's every chance your daughter can bring her grades up but she'll need to commit to hard work next year.\nI would recommend she sits down with her subject tutors to talk over her unit marks so she can identify the areas in which she did well and where there's room for improvement.\nYou don't mention which subjects she's studying specifically, but changes to the structure of AS and A-levels means that the two qualifications are essentially now decoupled for many subjects including English, the sciences, history and art - meaning it's all to play for in her end-of-year A-level exams in Year 13 in any case. We've summarised these changes on the Which? University website.\nBest of luck to your daughter for the year ahead.\nAlex\nMy granddaughter has gained 2 Cs, a D and an E, in her AS subjects but unfortunately the E is in business studies which is what she wants to do at university. What chance will she have of getting an offer from a good university?\nSusan, Lincolnshire\nHi Susan,\nYour granddaughter is lucky to have you so interested in helping her achieve her goals.\nThe first thing to consider is what makes a good university. For every student, this means a slightly different thing. For example, someone might get the grades to successfully apply for Oxford or Cambridge but the environment there may be completely unsuitable for them and they could struggle. However, a \"lower standard\" university might allow them to flourish and achieve things they never would have been able to elsewhere.\nBusiness studies is a very varied university subject and so a student might not necessarily need a specific business studies qualification to be accepted for a course. The Ucas website lists the entry requirements for all courses at every UK university.\nAlso, universities will make offers based on predicted grades and these grades are produced by your granddaughter's teachers. If they feel her AS levels haven't fulfilled her potential, the chances are that her predicted A-level grades will still allow her to apply to many different universities.\nTom.\nHi Susan,\nWell done to your granddaughter but commiserations if she is feeling disappointed with her business studies result. It will not count towards her final A-level result next year but it is likely to influence the predicted gradess. So she needs to set her sights realistically on universities and courses that play to her strengths.\nShe should speak to her teachers about the year ahead. Something worth mentioning is that many business studies degrees don't require you to have business studies A-level.\nSo perhaps she should consider pursuing the subjects she scored better in to keep her options broad. Either way, she certainly shouldn't lose hope of a place at university this time next year,\nWishing her well for the year ahead,\nAlex.", "summary": "While some young people celebrate their A-level results, others will have very different emotions after not receiving the results they were expecting.", "id": "37084682"}

They're all playing a similar kind of football but all doing it completely differently.\"\nThis club needs to be a Premier League club one day\nRobinson was aged just 29 in May 2010 when Winkelman promoted him from Paul Ince's assistant to full-time boss after former England midfielder Ince left Stadium:MK.\nFailures in successive League One play-off campaigns in his first two seasons in charge showed signs of things to come, and Robinson finally delivered promotion to the Championship in 2015 thanks in no small part to the goals of on-loan Will Grigg and Benik Afobe.\nBut after a dismal Championship season in which they got relegated with only four wins from January onwards, Robinson left on Sunday with the Dons 19th in League One.\n\"Ironically it's that promotion that changes the whole nature of club and we came back to League One with this burden of expectation that we need to be a Championship club,\" said Winkelman.\n\"To be honest, this club needs to be a Premier League club one day. I've built a Premier League stadium, Milton Keynes is going to be a top-10 city in the country and we need to have a top-10 ambition.\n\"It's one thing thinking it, it's another thing delivering it. But where we cannot be is 19th in League One. It's the lowest position we've been in since this stadium. We're going backwards, not forwards.\"\nIt was during that promotion-winning campaign that one of the club's greatest nights to date came - when they defeated Louis van Gaal's Manchester United 4-0 in the League Cup.\nAnd Robinson, despite the club finding itself in one of its worst positions since he took over, said his overriding feeling after leaving the club is pride. Why?\n\"The people of Milton Keynes, the identity, the growth of youth in Milton Keynes and the net profit in transfer fees in six years, the development of young players,\" he told BBC Three Counties Radio.\n\"The dream was to fill the stadium - (I was the) first person to do that, the first person to beat AFC Wimbledon.\n\"50% of the squad is home-grown, which is phenomenal in modern-day football I think.\"\nInstead of dissecting Saturday's 3-0 defeat by Southend United, a solitary Robinson pitched up at a golf course on Monday, trying to take a step back from what had happened.\n\"I still believed they'd finish in the play-offs. I said that to the chairman on Sunday,\" he continued. \"But I have no arguments with the decisions that were made. I have no problems with anybody.\"\nAlso left working out what has gone wrong are Dons fans, some of whom are unhappy with the recruitment strategy, overseen by the chairman's son Bobby.\nThe club use a recruitment database first set up by Paul Mitchell, who went on to work with Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton and Tottenham, to help make a list of potential signings.\nBut fan questions have arisen after players such as Matthew Upson, Dale Jennings and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas failed to make an impact in the club's Championship season.\n\"We've made mistakes when we haven't signed to the (recruitment) list: 85% of the players last year weren't on our recruitment list,\" said Pete Winkelman.\n\"It's something we've put more right this year, but again, not all of them were on the list.\n\"There are successes and failures in that recruitment list, but the successes hugely outweigh the failures.\n\"I want to get rid of this thing that we make decisions. I've never picked the team, other than the amount of money people can spend on somebody. I've never had any other influence in the football, and nor has Bob.\n\"People trying to get at me will get at Bob. It's an easy hit but what I can rely on is one of the strongest databases in football.\"\nWinkelman now has to sift through \"around 200\" names and is even considering creating a technical director role to work alongside the new manager.\nMeanwhile, Robinson wants to get back into management as soon as possible and has already been asked whether he would ever want to return to MK Dons.\n\"It was a very strange question to be asked 24 hours after leaving. But, do you know what, my answer to that was '100%',\" he said.\n\"I would love to manage the club again someday. That's the emotional ties we have with the football club.\"", "summary": "From builders and bakers to door handle makers, the replacement for any longstanding member of staff will sometimes sneeringly be told \"that's not how they used to do it\".", "id": "37765880"}

{"document": "It is a question that has long seemed impossible to answer, since players from different decades can never face each other at their peaks.\nAdd in an element of nostalgia - who doesn't have a rose-tinted view of the teams they watched as a child? - plus the fact that fleeting glimpses of star players have been replaced by wall-to-wall television coverage, and it is quite a challenge to consider the merits of teams across eras.\nHere, with the help of SAM, the super computer built by Salford University professors Ian McHale, Rose Baker and others, BBC Sport assessed every side to have played an international match and analysed every international result.\nTaking into account a range of factors - including goals scored, goals conceded, the strength of the opposition faced and whether or not results were achieved in major tournaments - we have come up with the top 10 teams of all time.\nThere are no English or Italian teams. As for the winners? You might well be surprised.\nLine-up: Sepp Maier, Berti Vogts, Franz Beckenbauer, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, Paul Breitner, Rainer Bonhof, Uli Hoeness, Wolfgang Overath, Jurgen Grabowski, Gerd Muller, Bernd Hölzenbein.\nWest Germany had come close to winning the World Cup twice in the preceding decade, losing 4-2 to England at Wembley in 1966 and 4-3 to Italy in a spectacular semi-final in Mexico four years later - so the stage was set for it to be third time lucky for veteran coach Helmut Schoen and his team as the host country in 1974.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThey were guided on the pitch by an all-time great in the shape of Franz Beckenbauer. They had world-class defender Berti Vogts in their ranks. Wolfgang Overath was the midfield strategist and in attack they had the marksman supreme in Gerd Muller, scorer of 14 goals in 13 World Cup matches.\nTheir meeting with the Netherlands in the final got off to the worst possible start when they conceded a first-minute penalty, but through sheer determination, and no little quality, they fought their way back to win through Paul Breitner's penalty and, inevitably, a winner from Muller.\nThis West Germany side will not be remembered with the same fondness as some of the teams on this list but, like so many of their compatriots down the years, they got the job done.\nLine-up: Fabien Barthez, Lilian Thuram, Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly, Bixente Lizarazu, Patrick Vieira, Didier Deschamps, Youri Djorkaeff, Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, Christophe Dugarry.\nJust look at that line-up! Built around star midfielder and three-time world player of the year Zinedine Zidane, this was the team that began the Euro 2000 final, a side so strong that two of Europe's finest players at the time, Robert Pires and David Trezeguet, could not get in the first XI.\nIt was a group consisting largely of the players who won France's first World Cup in 1998, but with a few tweaks.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOne, in particular, took the French to the next level. Out went striker Stephane Guivarc'h, scorer of just one goal in 14 internationals, and in came 22-year-old Thierry Henry, a forward who would go on to score 51 goals in an international career spanning 13 years.\nWith Laurent Blanc in for Frank Leboeuf in defence, Patrick Vieira replacing Emmanuel Petit in midfield and attacker Christophe Dugarry taking Christian Karambeu's place, France became the first team in 26 years to win a World Cup and European Championship back-to-back - West Germany won the Euros in 1972 and followed that by claiming the 1974 World Cup.\nLine-up: Sergio Romero, Walter Samuel, Gabriel Heinze, Martin Demichelis, Nicolas Otamendi, Javier Mascherano, Maxi Rodriguez, Angel Di Maria, Gonzalo Higuain, Carlos Tevez, Lionel Messi.\nThink Argentina and the mind instantly conjures images of Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Two iconic players, global superstars, both of whom led their sides to World Cup finals - Maradona winning one in 1986 and losing one in 1990, Messi losing out in 2014.\nBut none of those three teams make it in to our top 10, and there is space for only one of Argentina's two most famous players.\nFor all Maradona's individual brilliance, the 2010 side featuring Messi - as well as Carlos Tevez, Angel Di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain - are considered the best Argentina has produced. Bear in mind the fact Sergio Aguero was predominantly only a substitute and you get a sense of their attacking strength.\n\"To any football fan, it is odd that the results show that the 2010 team would beat the 1986 team,\" says Professor McHale.\n\"But there are some things that data and statistics can't pick up on - the human spirit, mental fortitude, attitude when things aren't going for you. There is only so much it can tell.\n\"The 1986 team lost 11 times in the three-year sample period, in part because they often played weakened teams in friendlies for a variety of reasons. That helps to explain why a team as brilliant as Maradona's 1986 side do not make the list.\"\nWhile Argentina 2010 are perhaps the surprise entry on this list, their results in the period suggest they deserve their place. Less than two months after Spain won the World Cup, the world champions were thrashed 4-1 in Buenos Aires, a result Argentina followed up two months later with a 1-0 win over Brazil.\nLine-up: Felix, Carlos Alberto, Everaldo, Brito, Piazza, Clodoaldo, Gerson, Jairzinho, Rivelino, Tostao, Pele.\nFor many, the greatest team of all time. But not when judged by cold, hard stats.\nPele led the way for Brazil during this period, but the names of his colleagues roll off the tongue as a list of the game's greats: captain Carlos Alberto, Gerson, Tostao, Jairzinho, Rivelino.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn 1970 alone, they played 14, won 12 and lost only once, scoring four or more goals five times. Therein lies part of the explanation as to why they do not feature further up the list - their opponents were often relatively weak, meaning victories earned them less credit in our ranking system.\nThis team, though, were the stuff of fantasy, regrouping after a below-par performance in England four years earlier when Pele was kicked out of the tournament. Mexico 1970 was the great man's World Cup finale after his first win in Sweden in 1958 and he bade farewell in style.\nEngland pushed them closest in a classic group game in Guadalajara settled by Jairzinho's goal, and this was a team so good they were even able to carry a goalkeeping liability in Felix with no ill effects.\nThe final against Italy in Mexico's Aztec Stadium was their showpiece. Goals from Pele, Gerson, Jairzinho and the brilliant flourish of passing to set up Carlos Alberto for the most famous goal in the 4-1 win was the crowning glory for an utterly brilliant side.\nLine-up: Jan Jongbloed, Ruud Krol, Wim Rijsbergen, Wim Suurbier, Wim Jansen, Arie Haan, Wim van Hanegem, Johan Neeskens, Johan Cruyff, Rob Rensenbrink, Johnny Rep.\nOne of the greatest teams never to win the World Cup. The Dutch were masterly throughout the 1974 tournament, demonstrating a tactical and technical ability far above every other team, guided on the pitch by the brilliant Johan Cruyff and off it by the master of \"Total Football\", the visionary coach Rinus Michels.\nCruyff led a team full of talent in defender Ruud Krol, midfielders Arie Haan and Johan Neeskens as well as forwards Johnny Rep and Rob Rensenbrink.\nIn the goalless draw against Sweden, the \"Cruyff turn\" was invented, as the great man bamboozled Jan Olsson with a piece of football ballet that will forever bear his name.\nThe Netherlands then gave masterclasses against Argentina, who they beat 4-0, and the fading reigning champions Brazil, where they won 2-0. The victory was far more convincing than the scoreline suggests.\nThere was a touch of arrogance about this side and it cost them in the final against West Germany in Munich. Instead of capitalising on Neeskens' first-minute penalty they wanted to humiliate their opponents - allowing the ruthless hosts to recover and claim the World Cup with a 2-1 win.\nLine-up: Manuel Neuer, Holger Badstuber, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Philipp Lahm, Sami Khedira, Toni Kroos, Mesut Ozil, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Miroslav Klose, Thomas Muller\nThis was the team that laid the foundations for the World Cup win that was to follow in 2014.\nA side which mixed the experience of Miroslav Klose (who would go on to become the all-time World Cup top scorer with 16 goals) and Bastian Schweinsteiger with a younger generation that included Manuel Neuer, Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller, their quarter-final win against Greece at Euro 2012 was their 15th consecutive competitive victory.\nThe defeat by Italy in the semi-finals of that tournament would prove to be little more than a blip, as Joachim Low's side embarked on a new run of 18 competitive matches unbeaten, a sequence which included a remarkable 7-1 thrashing of hosts Brazil and ended with a World Cup final victory against Argentina.\nLine-up: Julio Cesar, Dani Alves, Marcelo, Thiago Silva, David Luiz, Bernard, Paulinho, Oscar, Hulk, Neymar, Fred\nA year away from hosting their own World Cup, Brazil could hardly have been better positioned to succeed on home soil.\nAn 11-game unbeaten run in 2013 culminated in five straight wins at the Confederations Cup, a tournament which doubled as a dry run for the main event the following summer. Not only did Brazil win that competition but they did so in style, beating France 3-0 and Italy 4-2 before hammering world and European champions Spain 3-0 in the final.\nThey were the world's in-form team and, with Neymar as their talisman, continued their impressive record in to World Cup year, recording 10 wins in a row and 13 out of 14 in total.\nYet for all that promise, this will be a team forever associated with one of the great humiliations in modern sport. A game away from a final at the Maracana in Rio, Brazil were 5-0 down to Germany in the semi-final inside 29 minutes and were eventually demolished 7-1.\nIt was a one-off - Brazil went on to win 11 straight matches after the World Cup, including victories against Argentina and France - but that defeat by Germany is a result that will always define them.\nLine-up: Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Joan Capdevila, Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, David Villa, Fernando Torres\nThe inventors of tiki-taka, Spain imposed their own brand of football on the world from 2008 onwards, helped in no small part by the success of a Pep Guardiola-inspired Barcelona, whose players formed the core of the national team.\nWith Andres Iniesta and Xavi the heartbeat of the side, Spain became the first team to win back-to-back European Championship titles (in 2008 and 2012), while they ended their wait for World Cup success when they became the first European nation to win the competition outside of their own continent by lifting the trophy in South Africa in 2010.\nIt was a period of unprecedented dominance. Under Luis Aragones and then Vicente del Bosque, Spain set a new world record of 15 consecutive wins and went unbeaten for 35 matches.\nThe team of 2010 boasts an 84% win percentage and the majority of the players above were involved in all three tournament successes, but that is not quite enough to make the top two.\nLine-up: Claudio Taffarel, Cafu, Roberto Carlos, Aldair, Marcio Santos, Dunga, Juninho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Bebeto, Romario\nBrazil went unbeaten from November 1993 to January 1996, a period stretching 28 games, taking in a World Cup win and including victories against Argentina (twice), Netherlands and England, among many others. Their scintillating form continued, as they lost just once in 20 matches in the 1996-97 season, a campaign which culminated in a Copa America triumph.\nThose runs are hardly surprising when you look at the players at manager Mario Zagallo's disposal - he had three of Brazil's six all-time leading goalscorers to choose from.\nRonaldo, scorer of 15 World Cup goals, was just three years in to his international career in 1997, working his way into a team which could boast two of the leading scorers at the 1994 World Cup - Romario (five) and Bebeto (three). Not a bad array of attacking power.\nThis side was made up of a group of players who won that World Cup and were beaten finalists in 1998 - a rare example of a team maintaining its strength over a four-year cycle and reaching consecutive finals.\nLine-up: Gyula Grosics, Jeno Buzanszky, Mihaly Lantos, Borzsei Janos, Jozsef Zakarias, Jozsef Bozsik, Zoltan Czibor, Ferenc Szusza, Ferenc Puskás, Nandor Hidegkuti, Sandor Kocsis\nHungary, the best team of all time? Bear with us...\nThe Mighty Magyars dominated world football in the early 1950s, inspired by the genius of Ferenc Puskas. This was a team embarking on a run of more than four years without defeat, and they would go on to reach the 1954 World Cup final.\nIn 1953 they humiliated England, a stunning 6-3 victory at Wembley exposing the Three Lions' deficiencies as they lost a home game to a non-British or Irish team for the first time. England hoped for revenge in May of the following year in the return fixture but were left embarrassed once more as they were thrashed 7-1 in Budapest.\nSo strong was the Puskas led-side that, in that summer's World Cup, they would beat West Germany 8-3 and South Korea 9-0 in surely the greatest show of group-stage strength even seen at a major tournament.\nThey were only denied World Cup glory by the Miracle of Bern, with the West Germans defying the odds and memories of that heavy defeat weeks earlier to win the final 3-2 - after Hungary had gone 2-0 ahead in the opening 10 minutes. An ankle injury suffered by Puskas meant he was not fully fit in that game, hampering the Hungarians' attempts to cement their place as the world's greatest side.\nFor Hungary, their team of the time was perhaps the ultimate example of a \"golden generation\". As the graph below shows, it has pretty much been downhill ever since.\nHere's how the top three nations look when plotted alongside one another.\nNo English team makes it into the top 10, but which Three Lions side does the super computer rate as the best?\nDespite the 1966 squad winning the World Cup, it is actually the team from 1986 that comes out as the strongest England has produced.\nWith Gary Lineker the tournament's leading scorer, who knows how far they might have gone - and where they would appear in our top 10 - had Maradona and the Hand of God not intervened?\nAdditional words by Phil McNulty", "summary": "Which team can claim to be the greatest international side of all time?", "id": "36387046"}

For the most part, however, the public and policymakers are failing to recognise - or choosing to ignore - the severity of the situation.”\nIt says the cocktail of threats facing the ocean is more powerful than the individual problems themselves.\nCoral reefs, for instance, are suffering from the higher temperatures and the effects of acidification whilst also being weakened by bad fishing practices, pollution, siltation and toxic algal blooms.\nIPSO, funded by charitable foundations, is publishing a set of five papers based on workshops in 2011 and 2012 in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN’s) World Commission on Protected Areas.\nThe reports call for world governments to halt CO2 increase at 450ppm. Any higher, they say, will cause massive acidification later in the century as the CO2 is absorbed into the sea.\nIt urges much more focused fisheries management, and a priority list for tackling the key groups of chemicals that cause most harm.\nIt wants the governments to negotiate a new agreement for the sustainable fishing in the high oceans to be policed by a new global high seas enforcement agency.\nThe IUCN’s Prof Dan Laffoley said: \"What these latest reports make absolutely clear is that deferring action will increase costs in the future and lead to even greater, perhaps irreversible, losses.\n\"The UN climate report confirmed that the ocean is bearing the brunt of human-induced changes to our planet. These findings give us more cause for alarm – but also a roadmap for action. We must use it.\"\nThe co-coordinator, Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University has been asked to advise the UN's own oceans assessment but he told BBC News he had led the IPSO initiative because: \"It’s important to have something which is completely independent in any way from state influence and to say things which experts in the field felt was really needed to be said.\"\nHe said concern had grown over the past year thanks to papers signalling that past extinctions had involved warming seas, acidification and low oxygen levels. All are on the rise today.\nHe agreed there was debate on whether fisheries are recovering by better management following examples in the US and Europe, but said it seemed clear that globally they were not.\nHe also admitted a debate about whether overall climate change would increase the amount of fish produced in the sea. Melting sea ice would increase fisheries near the poles whilst stratification of warmer waters in the tropics would reduce mixing of nutrients and lead to lower production, he said.\nHe said dead zones globally appeared to be increasing although this may reflect increased reporting.\n\"On ocean acidification, we are seeing effects that no-one predicted like the inability of fish to detect their environments properly. It’s clear that it will affect many species. We really do have to get a grip on what’s going on in the oceans,\" he said.\nFollow Roger on Twitter", "summary": "The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than had previously been thought, a report says.", "id": "24369244"}

{"document": "You might forgive Laura Trott and Jason Kenny for leaving Rio rather full of themselves. Five competitions between them, five golds won. As of Tuesday night, had the couple been a country they would have sat 13th on the medal table, above Jamaica, Kenya and Brazil.\nThat would be to misunderstand what makes them tick. This is a couple who got engaged while on the sofa watching an episode of EastEnders.\nYou might think too that it would get competitive around the breakfast table in the cottage they share just outside Knutsford in Cheshire. Kenny now has six Olympic golds from three Games, more than Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bradley Wiggins. Trott has four, more than any other British woman, and from one fewer Olympics.\nThat would be to misjudge their relationship. Cycling superstars on their own, together they can be almost ordinary, almost invisible. After the gold rush, after their tearful embrace in the Rio velodrome with the world watching on, that may be about to change.\n\"The difference in their characters is what makes it work for them,\" says Trott's father Adrian.\n\"Until he gets to know you, Jason is a little bit shy. He's quiet and understated. Laura is bubbly, chatty, just as you see in her interviews.\n\"If they were both like Jason, God only knows how they'd talk about anything. And God forbid having two Lauras in a household!\"\nThe relationship between the two began in the build-up to London 2012, with Kenny about to come out of Chris Hoy's muscled shadow at his second Olympics and Trott about to experience her first.\n\"I remember seeing Laura at the velodrome years ago,\" says Kenny's mother Lorraine.\n\"I said to my husband, 'Flipping heck, you need to watch this young lady.' She was in the elimination race, only a tiny thing, and she kept sprinting over the top of everyone. She was amazing.\n\"The first time I knew something was happening between the two of them was when Jason phoned me up and said, 'I'm bringing Trotty home for a bacon butty.'\n\"I said to him, 'Is she your girlfriend?' 'No, she's just a friend.'\n\"She made herself at home straight away. Into the house, sat down, feet up on the sofa.\n\"We liked her from the off. She's a girly girl, so I can talk make-up and clothes to her. It's such a treat - having had two sons, I've had years of remote-control cars and standing out in the rain, and at last I can talk to someone about posh shoes.\"\nTrott and Kenny are not the first couple to both win Olympic golds.\nSome (Steffi Graf, ladies' singles 1988, Andre Agassi, men's singles 1996) have carried more global renown. Others have also won gold in the same sport at the same Games, most recently triathletes Jan Frodeno and Emma Snowsill at Beijing in 2008. But no-one at a summer Games has more. No-one else gets even close.\nNeither has the British duo finished. Trott is 24, Kenny 28. The next Olympics in Tokyo are in their sights.\n\"When I first met Laura, what stuck in my mind was how she was on what she wanted to achieve,\" says her agent Luke Lloyd Davies.\n\"She said to me, 'I want to be the most decorated British Olympian of all time'. I remember thinking, for a 21-year-old to have that determination is remarkable.\n\"She reminds me of [former England rugby union player] Jonny Wilkinson - that same dedication, the way nothing will faze her in competition. Off the bike she is a really sweet 20-something. She likes getting dressed up, she dreams of Mulberry bags and Prada shoes. But when her peers are out partying, she is burying herself in training.\"\nAnd there is nothing glamorous about the sessions each put in at the velodrome at Manchester's Sportcity each day. Lap after 250m lap, staring at the black line and scuffed boards, round and round, lactic in the legs, fire in the lungs.\n\"It hurts so badly,\" Trott once told me. \"It's like your legs are getting squeezed. You try to fight against it, but it's horrible, and they're just getting tighter and tighter. You're going slower and slower.\"\nNothing has come easy. Born six weeks premature with a collapsed lung, Trott spent the first weeks of her life in intensive care. As a child she suffered serious asthma; at the exact moment she first sat on a bike, aged four, her big sister Emma - who would go on to race professionally for the Dutch team Dolmans-Boels - was crashing and breaking her leg at the bottom of the same hill.\nAs a young girl she preferred trampolining to her bike, only to be forced to give it up after repeatedly passing out in mid-air. \"I kept getting dehydrated during sessions, because you had to go out of the room to get a drink, and I was like, 'Nah, I'll carry on bouncing'.\"\nThat's the heroic stuff. Not everything she does ends in such glorious success,\n\"Laura is the sort of person who can ruin a baked potato in a microwave,\" says Adrian.\n\"We've always cooked with gas at home, but when she first moved into the British Cycling academy flats in Manchester, they had electricity instead. She put a potato in the oven to bake and thought she'd turned the gas on - except she'd put the grill on instead. Pretty soon it was on fire. She smoked the whole flat out.\"\nSo it is that Kenny tends to be entrusted with kitchen duties.\n\"He is a very good cook,\" says Lorraine. \"He now does a brilliant Sunday roast, although he never used to cook when he lived at home. He says Laura is the bad influence, that she's the one who buys the chocolate.\n\"He gets his sporting genes from me. I used to run 100m and 200m. His dad Michael is very self-disciplined, and Jason has inherited that from him.\n\"Unlike me, he copes well under pressure. I have to force myself to watch him in big finals. I used to put my hands over my eyes, but then he lost a race when I was doing that so I've had to go back to actually looking.\n\"When they were younger, we took both our boys to different sports - they were lively lads, so we were trying to keep them out of mischief. We were just an ordinary family, and he was an ordinary boy doing ordinary things.\n\"He's not changed at all. He's just Jason. His elder brother Craig is the chatterbox, so maybe Jason thought he never needed to talk. But he has a fantastic sense of humour. It's so dry I think sometimes people don't get it.\"\nFind out how to get into cycling with our special guide.\nWhen they return to the UK, Trott and Kenny will wind down by walking their two dogs, springer-poodle crosses named Pringle and Sprolo. In September they will get married. Already they have turned down an offer to have it featured in a magazine.\nFame has never been the driving force. Kenny may have 54,000 followers on Twitter, but he last tweeted in early July. Trott may have won more Olympic gold medals than any other British woman, but the motivation remains pure.\n\"It isn't a job to me, but if it did feel like one, it would be a dream job,\" she says. \"All I do is ride my bike for four hours a day and then lie on the sofa for the rest of it. I don't feel like I'd ever fall out of love with it.\"\nAnd each understands exactly what the other is going through. How could they not, when together they have turned a cottage in Cheshire into a medal factory?\n\"If I was in a relationship with someone outside cycling,\" says Trott, \"just imagine how hard it would be.

Women's football in England is now worthy of that stage and as one of the first two teams to play this historic occasion, we will be proud to be part of another pioneering moment.\nIn the build-up to the game, some of my team-mates have been asking me about playing at Wembley, having played there for England against Germany last November and while representing Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympics.\nI can only say that it is a unique, out-of-body experience to play in front of so many people. It's a feeling that never gets old and we will be going to Wembley before Saturday so that those new to it can get a feel of the iconic 90,000-seat stadium.\nIn attempting to win Chelsea's first piece of silverware, it's the biggest game in the club's history, but one thing I've been telling them is we have to play the game and not the occasion.\nI wouldn't care if it was being played in a local park in Wembley, the most important thing is to win.\nWith Chelsea's men's team also playing at Wembley the following day when the Premier League champions take on FA Cup winners Arsenal in the Community Shield, we want to make it a historic weekend.\nThere are many players in our team who have won the FA Cup before, including myself.\nThe first time was in 2005 with Charlton when I scored the winner against Everton and in 2012 I was part of the Birmingham team which beat Chelsea on penalties following a 2-2 draw.\nIn our dressing room we have midfielder Katie Chapman, who has won the FA Cup eight times, and Gilly Flaherty, who has won it five times, so we are not lacking pedigree.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut having missed out on WSL so narrowly last season [on goal difference to Liverpool], it's fair to say that this could mean more because of the journey we have been on together.\nDespite losing our last two league games, we aren't panicking. We have strong characters in the dressing room and the belief that got us to the FA Cup final and saw us go unbeaten in 13 matches this year.\nThere has been plenty of talk about the fact that our unbeaten start to the league season has come to an end.\nIt would have been nice to hold onto that record, but the WSL is a very competitive league and every team in it has dropped points. We were the last to do so. We didn't play well in a 4-0 loss at Sunderland but the promoted side are now top of the league and our defeat by Manchester City last Sunday came courtesy of a very fortunate winner. Despite the result, our performance was pleasing.\nWe are a point off the top with five games left and to be in that position in such a competitive season is positive.\nOur focus is now on Saturday and we are confident we can win.\nAnother positive from the World Cup has been the boost to crowds in the WSL.\nThe first weekend after we arrived back saw record numbers for Manchester City, while 2,061 watched Liverpool beat Arsenal, and more than 1,200 saw us beat Bristol.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThree weeks after our return, the bounce has lasted. Our first home defeat in more than 18 months by Manchester City was watched by a club-record 1,857 at Staines FC.\nThose numbers are a credit to marketing staff at WSL clubs and the players, who are obviously putting on a good show in order to entice supporters back. The time we spend with fans immediately after games also helps too, I think.\nThe test now comes when the Premier League starts on 8 August.\nWith the Continental Cup now under way again, our season doesn't end until October, so hopefully the upsurge in attendances will continue and women's football will still very much be something people want to watch.\nEngland and Chelsea forward Eniola Aluko was speaking to BBC Sport's Alistair Magowan.", "summary": "Since returning from the Women's World Cup, it's been a pleasant surprise that more and more people have approached me in the street and congratulated England on finishing third.", "id": "33716014"}

All in all, a tricky man to shop for. Here's what Mr Rodman bought the man he called his \"friend for life\".\nGift one was President Donald Trump's 1987 ghostwritten bestseller The Art of the Deal, a guidebook on how to negotiate some of the best deals.

A seemingly bizarre gift for a world leader. Then again, could this somehow allow Mr Kim to practise for when he needs to pick a friend out of the crowd?\nAs for buying him the Totally Essential Travel Collection, Mr Kim has no known friendships with foreign leaders and rarely - if ever - leaves the country. Mr Rodman famously married himself in a public stunt, so we know he has a sense of humour.\nMr Kim is known to be a big fan of basketball, despite his singular dislike for the country that made the sport famous. He is said to have inherited the eccentric obsession from his father, the supreme leader, Kim Jong-il. In a failed diplomatic effort in 2000, then-US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright presented the elder Kim with a ball signed by Michael Jordan.\nDuring a visit in 2014, Mr Rodman played - and sensibly lost - an exhibition game against a Korean side in honour of Mr Kim's birthday. He also sung him happy birthday from the court.\nThis is probably the most sane gift of the lot.\nBoth the Rodman camp and the Trump administration have said publicly that Mr Rodman is not travelling on state-sanctioned 'basketball diplomacy'.\nSo either they're both lying, and the mermaid puzzle, ingeniously, once completed, carries a coded message, or they're telling the truth, and one of Dennis Rodman's gifts to the leader of North Korea was a mermaid puzzle.\nSo he panicked and grabbed a couple of things at the airport - you've never done that?", "summary": "What do you give the man who has an entire country at his mercy?", "id": "40283339"}

{"document": "Remarkably, this year's finale features the two franchises who have waited longer than any other to win a championship.\nCleveland's last title came way back in 1948. In ordinary circumstances a win for \"the Tribe\" would be a baseball fairytale: this year it would mostly be remembered for crushing Chicago's dreams.\nThe Cubs, despite being one of the most popular and historic franchises in baseball, have not won a World Series title since 1908.\nThey have not even played in the Fall Classic since 1945, when legend has it that a curse was placed on the team when a local tavern owner was asked to leave a game because the smell of his pet goat was upsetting other fans.\nBaseball is fond of hexes. The \"Curse of the Bambino\" - placed on the Boston Red Sox when they sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees - was blamed for the Red Sox's 86-year World Series drought, while the 1920 Black Sox betting scandal was fingered as the reason for the failure of the Cubs' cross-city rivals, the Chicago White Sox, to win a championship for 88 years.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut the Sox, red and white, finally came good in successive years a decade ago. The Cubs' winless streak stands at 108 years and counting.\nVarious, possibly more likely, reasons have been advanced for the Cubs' epic failure, including playing more daytime games than most (which some believe denies the players the opportunity to settle into a rhythm), a failure to tap into Latin American talent and a poor system for developing young in-house stars.\nSome also believe the innate pessimism of the fans creates a counter-productive atmosphere of tension at their beautiful but capricious Wrigley Field home - where the wind can swirl unpredictably - when things get tense at the business end of the season.\nIn 2003, the fan effect was more tangible when Steve Bartman covered himself in infamy by impeding a fielder's attempt to catch a key fly ball in a post-season game against the Florida (now Miami) Marlins. Needless to say the Cubs went on to lose the game, and the series and Bartman issued a public letter of apology.\nAs he puts it on his Twitter feed: \"Some people are remembered for a lifetime of great work, I'm remembered for five seconds.\"\nIn 2008, a priest even sprinkled holy water in the Cubs' dug-out before their National League Division Series against Los Angeles. They did not win a single game, losing the best-of-five series 3-0.\nSo why does 2016 finally promise something better?\nIt seems the key was to make Theo Epstein president of baseball operations in 2011. He is now the highest paid manager in US sport, reportedly on a five-year contract paying more than $50m (£40.87m).\nEpstein had already tasted success at the Red Sox, relying on a scientific, analytical method to identify talent. He has repeated the process in Chicago, transforming a team that finished in last place in the National League Central Division for the first three years of his presidency.\nThe batting line-up was the third most productive in the majors during the regular season.\nDynamic infielders Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo both achieved the notable double of driving in more than 100 runs and hitting more than 30 home runs.\nBut the Cubs' domination of their division, which they won for the first time since 2008 with three weeks of the season still to go, was primarily down to a group of pitchers as daunting as any seen in the major leagues in recent decades.\nThe key measure of a pitcher's effectiveness is the earned run average (ERA) - the average number of runs they give up during a full nine-inning game. The Cubs' Kyle Hendricks posted the lowest ERA in the major leagues, and team-mate Jon Lester was second.\nThe Cubs' bullpen - the group of relief pitchers who come into the game in the later stages when the starter has run out of steam - was also among the strongest in baseball.\nSceptics thought the Cubs might again struggle to maintain their form into the postseason, but they eased past the San Francisco Giants 3-1 in the National League Division Series, and then came roaring back from 2-1 down to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Championship Series.\nJust reaching the World Series prompted scenes of wild celebration.\nAs David Haugh from the Chicago Tribune put it: \"The reaction was visceral, the elation indescribable and the relief undeniable as a crowd of 42,386 fans unleashed 71 years' worth of frustration and disappointment.\"\nThe Indians comfortably won the American League Central Division, despite losing their best hitter Michael Brantley to injury for most of the season.\nBut with injuries to two of their key pitchers, few expected them to beat the Red Sox in the AL Division Series. In fact they swept the Sox, and went on to beat the Toronto Blue Jays in a low-scoring AL Championship Series.\nDeftly managed by Terry Francona, who won championships at Boston in 2004 and 2007, the Indians have proved themselves to be consummate battlers this year.\nReaching a World Series is an impressive achievement for a franchise with one of the smallest payrolls in baseball.\nBut many expect the Cubs to end their years of pain - if they can overcome their internal demons, and a smelly goat.", "summary": "The Chicago Cubs will be hoping to end the most infamous run of failure in US sport when they face the Cleveland Indians in the World Series, which starts on Tuesday.", "id": "37752440"}

This is an area where people come to drink. They do that because it is out the way.\n\"That brings with it anti-social behaviours and disorder, whether deliberate or otherwise. It damages the headstones as well, so there is a clearly a disrespectful aspect to that. The headstones have been here for hundreds of years and can be loose, and if they fall over they can cause serious injury.\n\"Primarily, we are talking about drinking in the Necropolis. Gang activity in the east end in general is very much in the decline in recent years.\"\nCh Insp Pettigrew said police officers take part in regular patrols of the necropolis during the spring and summer months, supported by teams from Community Safety Glasgow, who work in close consultation with the city council.\nThe senior officer said the teams from Community Safety sometimes patrol the area with mobile CCTV vans but he would like to see this taken a step further.\nHe added: \"CCTV has proven to be an effective aide to policing in many other parts of the city, so I think it would go without saying that it would be a benefit to this area also.\n\"The cameras themselves act as a deterrent because when people know they are here, they clearly don't have the same advantage as being able to hide behind a bush or a tree, but in the event that something happens it gives us the opportunity to find the people responsible.

And as far as many are concerned, that tells you something about Scotland today.\n\"There's more pride in Scotland generally,\" says Archie, a smiling accordion player from Skye. \"You'll get pubs that used to be trendy pubs, with CDs playing, and now they have folk music sessions.\"\nFor Sam, who plays violin, it's a particular source of pride that so many visitors from abroad now seem captivated by the melodies of her native land.\n\"You've got tourists from Canada, Australia, America, Japan, China. I've always liked this sort of music. It does make me feel like I'm celebrating being Scottish.\"\nIn a week when Scotland's First Minister unveiled plans for a possible second referendum on independence, the strength of nationalist sentiment has usually been gauged by polls.\nAnd much to the frustration of Ms Sturgeon's Scottish National Party, support for independence has barely budged from the 45% who voted for it in the previous referendum of 2014.\nYet many believe that Scots now have a far stronger sense of their country's distinct identity, a sentiment that polls seem to miss.\nAmong them is Henry McLeish, the Labour First Minister of Scotland from 2001-02, who extols what he believes are Scotland's particular qualities.\n\"We're more internationalist, we're more open to immigration,\" he says.\nIt is the Brexit vote and its aftermath that has done more than anything else to shift his opinion. The majority of Scots voted to remain in the European Union, in contrast to the UK vote to leave.\n\"I was a diehard unionist. Politics has changed, I've had my Britishness squeezed out of me. It's more in sorrow than in anger that I am ready to say that I could support an independent Scotland.\"\nMichelle Ferguson is not sorry about her increasingly strong sense of being Scottish, but it has come as something of a surprise.\nOnce an employee of a large multinational, she used to live in London and described herself as British. But Michelle has now become managing director of a social enterprise, St Andrews First Aid Supplies and Training, which ploughs all its profits back into the local community.\nThe experience seems to have changed her sense of identity, as much as her attitude to business.\n\"Here in Scotland, people really want to make a difference, it's not all about the big bucks,\" she says. \"I now feel that if I had to fill in a form… I would have to say I am Scottish.\"\nMichelle does not want to say whether she voted for Scottish independence, nor whether she would do so in the event of another referendum. And the fact is that whatever resurgence of Scottish pride there may be, the Scottish National Party has so far failed to capitalise on it.\nBut then the Party has always been keen to emphasise the alleged economic benefits of independence, rather than playing the identity game and appealing to voters' \"tartan blood\".\n\"A vote for independence should not just be about how we feel, although that is important,\" says Ben Macpherson, an SNP Member of the Scottish Parliament, representing Edinburgh North and Leith.\nYet pushed on the issue, Macpherson agrees with the suggestion of growing national self-awareness, and hints that it might help his cause.\n\"Scotland is an increasingly more confident country than when I was a child. More and more, Scotland is starting to understand that Scotland is ready to govern itself.\"", "summary": "The Scottish Government has published a bill outlining provisional plans for another referendum on Scottish independence, plans which some believe coincide with a renewed sense of Scotland's separate identity.", "id": "37732013"}

Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so.\nAndrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.\n\"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\"\nHe said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\".\n\"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added.\n\"It could be that Australia is odd.

Their businesses were nationalised and Mr Sarlan, who used to live in Rangoon (now called Yangon), and others became penniless refugees overnight.\nIt is estimated that nearly 300,000 Indians fled the country following the coup.\n\"After we reached India, for the first three months we were living in a refugee camp in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Though Tamil Nadu was the land of our forefathers, it was difficult to live there without any support,\" recalls Mr Sarlan, 74, who is now a social activist.\n'Mini-India'\nIndians lived in Burma for centuries, but large-scale migration took place during British-colonial rule, when the country was part of British India, during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were used as civil servants, traders, farmers, labourers and artisans - and came to be considered the backbone of the economy.\nBurmese nationalists always viewed them with suspicion and there were a series of anti-Indian riots in the 1930s. Once the British left in 1948, Indian-origin people became increasingly vulnerable and they were swiftly forced to leave following the 1962 coup.\nThey found it difficult to settle in India, so many decided to return to Burma by land. They vaguely knew that India's north-eastern states of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh shared a border with Burma.\nAfter weeks of travelling by train and bus a small group managed to reach Moreh, around 3,200km (2,000 miles) by road from Tamil Nadu. When they reached the border crossing, Burmese soldiers prevented them from entering the country.\nThe Tamils settled in Moreh hoping one day to return to their homeland - but those dreams have never been fulfilled.\n\"Moreh was a tribal village when we first came here. There was hardly any infrastructure at that point. But many Burmese people came to Moreh looking for Indian goods like automobile parts, clothing and cosmetics. Since we knew the Burmese language it was easy for us to start businesses,\" Mr Sarlan recalls.\nSoon, the Tamils in Moreh invited their relatives and friends from camps in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere to join them.\nMany went on to become Indian citizens.\nBy the 1990s the number of Burmese Tamils in Moreh had increased to about 15,000, almost half of the town's population. They had set up their own schools, temples, churches and mosques - and celebrated their cultural festivals with fervour. Moreh was described as a \"mini-India\".\n\"We still retain lots of cultural and social links with Tamil Nadu state. For our important temple festivals we bring priests and music performers from there. Many parents in Moreh also send their children to schools in Tamil Nadu,\" says K Balasubramaniam, who is the principal of a local secondary school.\nChinese goods\nAt one point, Burmese Tamils dominated local border trade and that led to resentment from the Kuki community and others.\nSeveral people were killed in bloody clashes between Tamils and Kukis in 1995, but relations have improved since then.\n\"We take part in each other's cultural and religious festivals. We have several committees to look into any problems and they get sorted out immediately,\" says Manohar Mohan, a Tamil businessman.\nTamil businesses suffered a setback after the Burmese government established a market just inside their border in Namphalong in the mid-1990s. Chinese products flooded in and many Burmese started shopping in Namphalong rather than Moreh.\nTraders in Manipur also faced threats from insurgents in the state - some of the businessmen who refused to pay \"extortion money\" were shot dead.\nThe violence and lack of business opportunities forced many traders and Burmese Indians to leave Moreh, many opting for Chennai. Now Moreh's Tamil population is just 3,500.\n'Gateway'\nThe insurgency has been contained to a large extent in the last few years. Many traders in Moreh hope the town will regain its business importance once the long-pending Asian Highway, linking the state capital Imphal with Yangon and Bangkok materialises.\nMoreh is considered to be India's gateway to South East Asia and locals believe because of its unique geography the place offers tremendous potential.\nThe story of the town's Burmese Tamils is one of suffering and resilience as well as achievement.\nMany elderly Tamils, originally from Burma, are nostalgic and want to stay in Moreh, as it is closer to where they come from.  But later generations say the town offers little in terms of education and employment.\n\"If we don't have the right education facilities then we have to go elsewhere. We can't do higher studies here. Also, girls can get only teaching jobs here in Moreh. So there are no other options but to leave this town and go to a place like Chennai,\" says B Revathy, a university student.\nEmotional attachment it seems may not be enough for Moreh to keep its Burmese Tamils.", "summary": "Every day Mohamed Eusoof Sarlan looks at his beloved homeland, a few hundred metres away from where he lives - but Myanmar's soldiers will not allow him to return to his country.", "id": "33973982"}

And we could do that, probably, more easily\".\nHe says there may also be benefits from focusing on individual conditions.\n\"Another area would be sepsis, which has a very large toll of mortality, probably much more significant than seems to be associated with seven-day working.\n\"Putting in some measures to spot that early and to intervene in a more effective way would have a big effect on people.\"\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt has defended the push for a seven-day NHS. He acknowledged there may be \"upfront costs\" of hundreds of millions of pounds, but he told the BBC there may also be similar levels of savings because of improved discharge from hospital.\nHe also argued the government was investing in other areas such as the new meningitis B vaccine, new cancer drugs and dementia.\nAnd he insisted there was strong support in the health service for the seven-day plan.\n\"For doctors who are totally passionate that the NHS should offer the best and safest care anywhere in the world, the knowledge that thousands of people die every year because we don't offer the same level of service at weekend as we do in the weeks is something that really worries them.\"\nThe chief executive of the Sepsis Trust, Dr Ron Daniels, welcomed the proposed emphasis on tackling the problem, which kills an estimated 37,000 people every year in the UK.\n\"Reducing deaths from sepsis is not rocket science but there's been relatively little investment in dealing with the problem.\n\"A stronger approach to tackling sepsis would be the quickest win towards saving lives and would require much less investment than a move to full seven-day services in the NHS.\"", "summary": "Ministers insist there is strong support for their seven-day NHS plans as experts challenge the policy.", "id": "34144692"}

She said that after the screams she heard four shots.\nMr Pistorius said he went back to the bedroom after shooting at the toilet door, still shouting for Reeva.

It was a bold decision but totally coherent with Pope Francis' philosophy of open discussion about moral arguments.\nPope Francis' focus today on Armenia, the first country to adopt Christianity as its state religion, even before the conversion of the Roman Emperor Constantine, serves as yet another reminder of the Catholic Church's widely spread roots in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.\nIn 2014, for the first time, Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences to the grandchildren of all the Armenians who lost their lives.\nBut he also said that it was inadmissible for Armenia to turn the issue \"into a matter of political conflict\".\nArmenia says up to 1.5 million people died in 1915-16 as the Ottoman Empire was disintegrating. Turkey has said the number of deaths was much smaller.\nMany of the victims were civilians deported en masse to barren desert regions where they died of starvation and thirst. Thousands also died in massacres.\nMost non-Turkish scholars of the events regard them as genocide. Among the other states which formally recognise them as genocide are Argentina, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and Uruguay.\nTurkey maintains that many of the dead were killed in clashes during World War One, and that ethnic Turks also suffered in the conflict.", "summary": "Turkey has recalled its envoy to the Vatican after Pope Francis described the mass killing of Armenians under Ottoman rule in WW1 as \"genocide\".", "id": "32272604"}

Handball will be a regular feature here.\nIf you missed it at London 2012, handball is played on an indoor court between two teams of seven players. To simplify things greatly, you use your hands to throw the ball into the opposing team's goal.\nFor handball's dedicated British fans, getting back in the Box at the Olympic Park has been a rare thrill.\n\"We're in our Wembley,\" says Paul Stewart, who plays for Ruislip Eagles and took part in one of Sunday's inaugural games.\n\"This is the pinnacle. You don't get to play in the biggest sports stadiums in football unless you're a pro.

I was thinking I'd come home bruised or not even bruised because I hadn't touched the ball... but it was so much fun.\"\nFor Dani Sposi, setting foot inside the Copper Box is bittersweet. A former member of the British handball team, she narrowly missed out on selection for London 2012.\n\"During preparations for the Games we used to go there once a month,\" she remembers. \"When I got there, I remembered the smell, all those times we used to train there.\n\"Being there as a player after the Olympics was a bit emotional, because I wasn't selected and it was very hard to go through all that disappointment.\n\"I had my six-year-old son, Matteo, with me. He said: 'Mum, why didn't you play at the Olympics?' I said: 'Well, the coach made a different decision, so mummy didn't play.'\nDani Sposi: \"We had loads of people coming into the Copper Box on Sunday and asking about handball. We had another area in the arena where we could explain what handball is all about and let them shoot at goal.\n\"Sometimes people don't realise how hard handball is. Even the parents are like 'oh, I'll do it' - and then 'oh, this is hard!' You have to find the right co-ordination with the three steps and the bounce.\"\nPaul Stewart: \"We had easily hundreds, probably a couple of thousand people all told. There were points when it was massively busy, queues of parents with children all holding a ball waiting to have a go. It was superb.\n\"At league level, for the next year or so, it's going to be massive. If we get the right publicity, if people can see the sport and know it's still carrying on in the Olympic venue, that might drag them in across the country.\"\n\"He has been with me the whole journey, since he was eight months old - all the training sessions, travelling around. It was very good for him to be there, to go inside the Olympic arena. Even during training, I never had the chance to bring him in.\"\nSposi's dream of an Olympic appearance for Great Britain has ended, but other players in the Box still aspire to fly the British flag - despite a critical shortage of funding leaving GB's elite teams in limbo.\n\"Playing in the Olympic venue was a proud moment,\" says Gil Lewis, another who only started playing after London 2012.\nLewis already has two university team-mates who have been selected for the England Under-20 squad within a year of taking up the sport; he himself was chosen to play for the British universities team, but their trip to a tournament in the Netherlands fell apart when the travel proved too expensive.\nA shortage of cash is a feature of life as a handball player in Britain, but Lewis is determined not to let it dampen his enthusiasm.\n\"This year I've been invited to move up to the first team; I was in shock when I was first asked. They've asked if I want to go to the Challenge Cup, playing in Bulgaria, and that would be an amazing experience,\" he says.\n\"That all has to be funded through ourselves and it's a lot of personal expense to play.

{"document": "Councils approved 1,584 applications from people with convictions.\nData obtained by the BBC also shows that councils received more than 1,200 taxi-related complaints in 2014 - a small rise on the previous year.\nBut the Scottish Taxi Federation said the public should not be concerned.\nBill McIntosh, general secretary of the body which represents the taxi trade, played down the conviction and complaint figures.\nHe said: \"All Scottish licensing authorities are required to ensure that in granting a licence to drive a taxi or a private hire car, the applicant meets with their interpretation of being a fit and proper person.\n\"[And] taking into account that there are approximately 36,500 licensed taxi and private hire car drivers throughout Scotland, and the many millions of journeys undertaken, it could be argued that the number of complaints made were in real terms relatively small.\"\nHowever, he added: \"This is not to suggest that we should be dismissive of the numbers.\"\nThe new figures - obtained through a series of co-ordinated freedom of information requests - come in the wake of Glasgow taxi driver Arshad Mohammed being found guilty of raping a female passenger.\nAnd an East Renfrewshire taxi driver is currently awaiting sentence after admitting placing female passengers in a state of fear or alarm and lying on his licence application.\nMichael Boyd, who had previously surrendered his East Ayrshire licence after a series of complaints, said on his application form that he had never previously held a taxi driver's licence.\nPolice Scotland said the relevant checks had been carried out at the time of Mr Boyd's application to East Renfrewshire, with a negative result.\nThe force said it was now developing a national IT system which would act as a \"single point of reference for licences that had been granted or revoked by the relevant local authority\".\nA recent amendment to the 1974 Rehabilitation of Offenders Act currently stipulates that applicants for taxi and private hire car licences must declare all previous spent and unspent convictions.\nEach council's licensing committee then typically consults with Police Scotland on all submitted taxi licence applications.\nThe committee then meets to discuss individual applications where objections have been raised, or inconsistencies have been detected, by the police.\nThe figures obtained by BBC Scotland show that the highest number of drivers with criminal histories have been issued licences by Glasgow (290), Edinburgh (257) and Falkirk (184) councils.\nMany of the convictions are related to common traffic offences such as speeding or running a red light.\nBut other convictions included assault, breach of the peace, car theft, drink-driving, indecent exposure and possession of an offensive weapon.\nTwo licensed drivers in the Borders had charges dating back to the 1970s related to unlawful carnal knowledge of girls under 17.\nIn East Ayrshire, a licence was issued to an individual who had carried out 49 offences, including assault and theft, as well as repeatedly driving while disqualified and without any insurance.\nIn that particular case, the council said a panel had fully considered all previous convictions - the last of which was from 2006.\nGuidance from the Scottish government suggests \"local licensing authorities will want to consider each case on its merits, but they will doubtless take a particularly cautious view of any offences involving violence, and especially sexual attack\".\nThe report was guided by a concern that \"the industry is protected from infiltration and targeting by organised crime groups\".\nA spokesperson for Highland Council said there were \"no hard and fast rules\" about who should be granted a licence.\n\"An applicant with a series of recent convictions, for example, is more likely to be considered not to be a fit and proper person than an applicant with older convictions whose record shows that he or she has not re-offended for a considerable time,\" it said.\nThe BBC Scotland investigation revealed that taxi-related complaints had doubled, and even trebled, in some council areas.\nAberdeen City Council received 144 complaints in 2014 - up from 51 the previous year.\nAnd the reporting of grievances doubled in East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, Highland and South Lanarkshire.\nThe most complaints were received by Edinburgh (340), North Lanarkshire (210), and Aberdeen (144).\nThe bulk of complaints were related to the personal behaviour of drivers, and dangerous driving.\nBut Highland Council also received complaints including tailgating, money laundering and the sale of drugs and alcohol from licensed vehicles.\nThe complaint data also revealed that an East Ayrshire driver had his licence suspended in February 2014 after allegedly \"placing a lone female in a state of fear and distress\".\nAssault and racial abuse were among the grievances filed to West Dunbartonshire council since 2010.\nThere were also complaints regarding public urination, fare disputes, vehicle conditions, drivers electing to take longer routes and refusals to take guide dogs.\nHowever, grievances were not only filed by passengers but also by other by other cabbies for infractions by drivers of private hire vehicles.\nOnly Hackney carriages may pick up passengers from authorised taxi ranks or if hailed in the street.\nA spokesperson for Falkirk Council said it was \"impossible\" to make any correlation between a driver's criminal history and the complaints.\nThe council said: \"Once a driver is licensed they are subject to an annual renewal process which enables both the police and the licensing authority to undertake checks on the continuing fitness of the driver.\"\nComplaints across Scotland rose marginally between 2013 and 2014, from 1,167 to 1,201.\nHowever, a number of councils refused to release their complaint data, or only released a portion of it, so the actual number of annual grievances is likely to be higher.\nMost councils in Scotland have enforcement units, empowered by the 1982 Civic Government Act, to investigate any alleged wrongdoing.\nBut the data obtained by BBC Scotland reveals that often many of the complaints are not upheld.\nNo action was taken in nearly 90% of the complaints submitted to Falkirk Council in 2014.\nIn South Ayrshire, two-thirds of complaints were not upheld.\nThe spokesperson for Falkirk Council said disciplinary action was often not taken due to a lack of evidence or corroboration of events.\nThey said: \"This is particularly the case when taxi drivers complain about each other and the licensing authority finds itself in a position of having to deal with 'tit for tat' complaints.\n\"Other types of complaints are not of the nature where formal action would be suitable, for example in relation to personal hygiene and appearance issues.\n\"There are, of course, a number of complaints where the complainant does not wish to pursue the matter beyond the driver being made aware of their complaint.\"", "summary": "Drivers with convictions for offences such as assault, housebreaking and drink-driving were issued taxi licences last year, a BBC Scotland investigation has revealed.", "id": "32478871"}

Chinese teenagers are the most likely to apply, followed by other Asian youngsters, with white teenagers the least likely to apply, with 29% seeking places.\n\"Our new analysis of demand by ethnic group shows that white pupils at English schools now have the lowest application rate of any ethnic group. There has been significant growth in demand from black pupils,\" says Ms Curnock Cook, the Ucas chief executive.\nNicola Dandridge, head of Universities UK, said the figures raised questions about \"why young white men from disadvantaged backgrounds are increasingly unlikely to apply to university\".\n\"It is critical that universities continue their outreach work to ensure that anyone who has the ability and potential to benefit from a university education should have the opportunity to do so,\" she said.\nThese figures show the proportion of young people in these ethnic groups who are applying - rather than the absolute numbers. Most applicants will still be white students, because it's a much larger group.\nFor instance, Ucas says the Chinese figure is based on about 2,000 youngsters, compared with about 500,000 white youngsters.\nMore youngsters from the poorest income groups are applying, but there are still significant gaps in terms of social background.\nTeenagers from the richest areas are more than four times as likely to apply to the most selective universities than youngsters from the poorest areas. Youngsters who were on free school meals are only half as likely to apply to university compared with the rest of their cohort.\nThere are big geographical divides. In England, 42% of 18-year-olds in London apply to university, compared with 31% in the north east.\nLondon state schools have been commended for having the best results in England.\nAcross the UK, Northern Ireland has a significantly higher level of applications than elsewhere, with 48% of 18-year-olds applying, compared with 31% in Wales.\nGender remains one of the biggest factors in application rates, with females remaining substantially more likely to apply. In 2012 in England, 49% of women applied compared with 38% of men.\nAll of these factors overlap, so that a woman from Northern Ireland is much more likely to seek a university place than a man from Wales and a white youngster from the north east of England is less likely to apply than a black teenager in London.\nLes Ebdon, director of the Office of Fair Access, welcomed the fact that the gap in applications between richest and poorest was narrowing.\nBut Universities UK warned that the figures did not show applications from mature and part-time students, which have been hit by the increase in tuition fees.\n\"Numbers of mature and part-time students have decreased considerably since 2010 and any further drop may have significant implications for potential students and the country as a whole,\" said Universities UK chief, Nicola Dandridge.\nA Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokeswoman said: \"These figures confirm that the desire to study at university remains strong, with application rates for 18-year-olds at near record levels.\n\"Some challenges remain but no one should be put off going to university for financial reasons.

{"document": "The proposals, by Leighton Andrews, to bring back bigger councils are broadly similar to pre-1996 arrangements.\nMr Andrews called the case for fewer local authorities \"compelling\".\nHowever, the plans have been criticised by the body representing local authorities, some Labour council leaders and an ex-Labour minister.\nMr Andrews's blueprint envisages the return of historical counties such as Dyfed and West Glamorgan.\nDyfed would be brought back by re-merging Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, and West Glamorgan would return by joining Swansea once more with Neath Port Talbot.\nCardiff would merge with the Vale of Glamorgan, while a merger between Caerphilly, Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent, Newport and Monmouthshire would create Wales' biggest council, with a population of nearly 600,000.\nBridgend would join Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr Tydfil.\nThe minister will consult further on whether to move to two or three councils in north Wales.\nIn the eight-council model, Anglesey, Gwynedd and Conwy would merge, as would Denbighshire, Wrexham and Flintshire.\nThe alternative would see Conwy and Denbighshire merging.\nThe cross-party Williams Commission advised against an eight-council structure, in January 2014, warning many gains from mergers would be \"jeopardised or lost\".\nThe report stated: \"Such proposals would mean creating local authority areas like the whole of Gwent or the whole of north Wales.  It would be very difficult to meet multiple diverse local needs effectively, or to maintain fair democratic representation within such areas.\"\nMr Andrews has dropped plans to place \"term-limits\" on councillors, whereby an individual would only be able to serve for 25 years.\nHe is also proposing the current cap of 75 members per council be raised to a higher level.\nIn a written statement, Mr Andrews added: \"I want to emphasise this is not a final decision. It is the next phase in discussions.\"\nA draft bill will be published in the autumn but no changes will be made before next spring's assembly election.\nMr Andrews is confident his plans are on the right side of the political argument, despite criticism from senior Labour council figures.\nHe told BBC Wales: \"Welsh Labour will be happy to go into the election next year campaigning to reduce the cost of politics and administration in local government.\"\nBut the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) dismissed the proposals, saying there was \"no political consensus\" on the future shape of councils, either across political parties in the assembly or between Welsh ministers and local authorities.\nThe WLGA called for an  \"urgent summit\" of council leaders and the Welsh government.\nAssociation leader Bob Wellington, also the Labour leader of Torfaen council, said: \"This summit could debate the way forward in terms of structures, but more importantly set in place a new vision for local government which is currently at the epicentre of public sector funding cuts and is having to carry a disproportionate share of the huge austerity burden.\"\nThere was fierce criticism of Blaenau Gwent's proposed merger with Caerphilly, Newport, Monmouthshire and Torfaen from its local Labour AM, a former environment minister.\nAlun Davies said such changes would \"only distract from the important issue of focusing on the challenges facing us as a borough\".\nUrging Welsh ministers to \"listen and to reach out with meaningful discussions\", he added: \"Simply issuing diktats is the worst way to promote debate and discussion.\"\nDominic MacAskill, from public services union Unison, said it would be \"demanding that staff, our members, are put at the heart of considerations and that Welsh government commits to providing adequate funding for the transition costs of any restructuring\".\nMr Andrew's proposals came under immediate fire from assembly opposition parties.\nConservative shadow local government minister Janet Finch-Saunders condemned what she called an \"uninspiring map\" chosen to \"best serve the tribal party political interests of the Labour Party instead of ensuring proper local representation for families across Wales or delivering efficient local services\".\nPlaid Cymru's Rhodri Glyn Thomas welcomed the fact the Welsh government had \"made clear its preferred map\", but criticised the plans for not integrating health and social care.\nLiberal Democrat AM Peter Black said \"shoving together existing councils in a botched party-political stitch-up serves no-one aside from the Labour party\".\n* There could be further consultation on merging Conwy and Denbighshire to create an additional council in north Wales.\nCOUNCIL LEADERS' REACTION\nBlaenau Gwent: Labour leader Hedley McCarthy said it appeared \"we are to be the periphery of a new mega-council which will be distant and remote from the people it is supposed to serve\".\nDenbighshire: Independent council leader Hugh Evans said the authority was \"unclear about what, if any, review has led to the current proposed map\".\nBut he said a possible consultation on combining Denbighshire with Conwy, rather than with Flintshire and Wrexham, deserved \"serious consideration\".\nGwynedd: Dyfed Edwards, a Plaid Cymru councillor, told BBC Radio Wales: \"I do think in the north, dividing along north east and north west is right. I think two authorities is enough for the north.\"\nMonmouthshire: Conservative Peter Fox accepted the need for some reform but expressed disappointment.\nHe said: \"We're back to the future it looks like. I believe in local identity and local decision making, I believe that's really important to people.\"\nPembrokeshire: Independent council leader Jamie Adams said he was worried about the \"obvious loss of local decision-making and accountability\" and the \"real damage reorganisation could do to a very successful brand\".\n\"I am referring to the Pembrokeshire name, which is instantly recognisable to those living far outside our county and even beyond Wales,\" he said.\nRhondda Cynon Taf: Labour council leader Andrew Morgan said: \"All council leaders will now need to consider the detail of the Welsh government's proposed map; I personally will want to remain focused on protecting the interests of services we provide to the communities we represent currently and the staff we employ to deliver them.\"\nSwansea: Labour council leader Rob Stewart said he did not think the planned merger with Neath Port Talbot held \"any fear\" for the two authorities.\nHe said: \"We already work as a city region. Swansea is undoubtedly the capital of that region but it doesn't mean people in other parts of the region should worry.\"\nVale of Glamorgan: Labour council leader Neil Moore said a plan for a voluntary merger involving his authority and Bridgend was turned down in January because it would cross a local health board boundary.\nHe called it \"bizarre\" and \"galling\" for Mr Andrews to now want Bridgend to join Merthyr and Rhondda Cynon Taf across another local health board boundary.\nANALYSIS BY VAUGHAN RODERICK\nThe third shake up in Welsh local government in 40 years would see the return of some familiar borders and names, the new all-purpose authorities roughly matching the eight counties which formed the upper tier of Welsh councils until 1996.\nWhile some will welcome the return of historical names like Gwent and Dyfed - others would mourn the passing of the equally historic names like Pembrokeshire and Monmouthshire.\nWhile sentiment may fire opposition to the changes in some areas, other will claim that the new authorities could prove remote and that any change would be a distraction at a time when local government is under severe financial pressure.\nMeanwhile the issue is likely to figure heavily in next year's assembly election, with all three opposition parties opposing the government's map.\nTHE CHANGING FACE OF WALES", "summary": "Reducing the number of councils in Wales from 22 to eight or nine would cut the cost of local government, the public services minister has said.", "id": "33161855"}

{"document": "You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.\nBut Shakespeare's Globe on London's Bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.\nEverything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics\nThe Globe's site beside the River Thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor Jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.\nBuilding this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.\nFarah Karim-Cooper, one of the Globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.\nThe design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of \"informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence\".\nBut this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating \"authenticity\", says Dr Karim-Cooper. The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.\n\"We're not interested in re-enactment,\" she says.\nBut she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice. Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?\nIt was something that happened regularly in Shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor Globe to an indoor playhouse such as the Blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the River Thames.\nIt must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub. The Globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.\nThe Globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.\nAnd in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.\nLight and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era. \"Darkness was a terrifying presence,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper.\n\"Darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick. It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there.\"\nShe says that if Elizabethans or Jacobeans travelled in time to modern London \"their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light\".\nAnother big difference is that Shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.\nThe modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.\nIn the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen. The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.\nAnd one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed Globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.\n\"It was a very social occasion,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper, describing the Shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.\n\"Contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,\" she says.\nPutting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.\nFor instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says Dr Karim-Cooper.\nModern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue. When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.\nThere are other big changes between a modern and Shakespearean theatre visit.\nIt would have smelled very different, says Dr Karim-Cooper. There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.\nAnother sensory difference would have been the \"soundscape\", she says. It would have been a much softer sound, as Elizabethan London didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.\n\"In terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,\" she says. \"There are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming. They never heard a plane taking off.\"\nThe language would have sounded unusual too. The accent of the time would have meant words such as \"move\" and \"love\" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.\nAnd the Globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.\nThe role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.\n\"There is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do. It wouldn't work,\" says Dr Karim-Cooper.\nInstead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions. They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.\n\"We want to get beyond Wikipedia,\" she says.\nShe is co-editor of Moving Shakespeare Indoors, a collection of essays on indoor Jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the Globe's work.\nThere is a postgraduate degree course in Shakespeare Studies with King's College, London. There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.\nEvery year there is a landmark schools production, the Playing Shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for London pupils. It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see Shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.\nDr Karim-Cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.\n\"We want to become a research hub. We want students to be here.\"\nThe \"unique blend\" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the \"literary rigour\".\n\"We don't separate the practical from the academic.\"", "summary": "When you think of a laboratory you wouldn't usually think of cheering crowds or actors in costumes.", "id": "28345611"}

{"document": "The report, carried out by charity Relate and based on a survey of 20,980 people in relationships from 2013-15, suggested 2.87 million people were in \"distressed\" relationships.\nDr David Marjoribanks, from Relate, said constant bickering could have a \"far-reaching\" impact on children.\nOn average they did worse in school and could even fall into crime, he said.\n\"It is not just the actual breakdown of the relationship itself, it's specifically the conflict that surrounds that,\" Dr Marjoribanks said.\n\"It means that when relationships end, it is not deemed to inevitably harm children, far from it.\n\"It is the conflict in intact relationships that can be just as damaging, as when relationships end,\" he added.\n\"Children who grow up with parents who have highly-conflicted relationships are much more likely to have mental and physical health problems, to not do as well at school and end up in antisocial behaviour and criminality even.\"\nIt may have seemed a small thing but Sophie*, 28, knew her marriage was over when she came home from work to have lunch with her out-of-work husband and he expected her to make it.\nThings had not been right for some time. There had been arguments about money, jobs and housework shortly after the wedding, often in front of their young son. But soon communication shut down almost entirely as both felt the arguments were always the same and nothing would ever change.\nDays would go by with neither of them talking to each other.\nThey tried counselling but it came at a cost and they found themselves forced to choose between a counselling session or buying food for the week.\nIn January last year, after three years of marriage, Sophie told her husband, 41, it was over.\n\"As soon as we separated I immediately felt lighter. I did not have to do all this stuff for someone who did not do anything,\" she said.\nBoth are now in new relationships, and Sophie, who lives in West Yorkshire, says she now tries to make time to talk about things as soon as they come up and to be more open about money.\n*Not her real name\nResearchers looked at data from the Understanding Society survey of 20,980 people which asked people how often they argued, how frequently they considered divorce and regretted the relationship, and the extent of their unhappiness.\nThey said their findings suggested 2.87 million people, which equates to 18% of married or cohabiting couples, were living in \"distressed\" relationships, where the strains were deemed to be \"clinically significant\" by counsellors.\nThe number of \"distressed\" relationships reached a high in 2011 and 2012 but have not yet returned to pre-recession levels, the data showed.\n\"There is a pattern of relationship strain increasing during recession years - where economic strain increases, for example low income, unemployment, a build-up of debt, the strain on the relationship increases,\" Dr Marjoribanks said.\nThe research also found:\nDr Marjoribanks said many couples suffered in silence for years and only sought help when it was too late to salvage their relationship.\nJan Artingstall from Therapy Cheshire, who is listed in the Counselling Directory, believes people today spend so much time communicating via text and social media that they have forgotten how to talk.\n\"People have lost the art of talking about how they feel. It's like we have gone back to being children who don't have the language to communicate feelings,\" she said.\nA common problem among couples was mistrust built around text messages sent between work colleagues and partners spying on each other's online communications, she added.\nHer advice is for couples to sit down for 10 minutes to talk about their day and take joint responsibility for the state of the relationship, rather than pointing fingers.\nShe also said children who saw their parents fall out and make up were learning a useful lesson but daily and embedded conflict was damaging.\n\"Children are very perceptive to atmosphere. It doesn't have to be a shouting match - they can pick up on stonewalling and tense body language.\n\"Children won't say 'Are you unhappy Mummy or Daddy?' They just accept and absorb the atmosphere and feel unhappy inside.\"\nThere were 114,720 divorces in England and Wales in 2013, down 3% on 2012, the most recent figures available from the Office of National Statistics show. The number of divorces was highest among men and women aged between 40 and 44.\nIn Scotland, 9,030 divorces were granted in 2014-15, 6% fewer than in the previous 12 months, Scottish government figures show. Northern Ireland saw a slight rise in divorce rates from 2,403 in 2013 to 2,455 in 2014, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.\nChris Sherwood, chief executive at Relate, said the report's findings were \"hugely concerning\", adding that \"families can't go on like this\".\nThe charity was launching its first national appeal, Breaking Point, calling for donations to help make its services available to everyone, not just those who could afford them, he added.", "summary": "Almost one in five (18%) couples in the UK argue regularly or consider separating, a study suggests.", "id": "36373299"}

Sinead Harnett was here the other day.\n\"Lewis Hamilton came here not long ago - but not to do a guest vocal.\"\nThe studio has been Tinie's second home since 2008. He recorded his million-selling debut Disc-Overy here. And it's where he's been obsessing over his third album, Youth, for more than two years.\nThe record has suffered a number of delays as the star revised and refined the tracklist. Part of the problem was that, after five years of success, he'd lost touch with his roots.\n\"I've been on the road literally since I released Pass Out,\" he says. \"I've been in my own world and my own head.\n\"My engineer Ritchie said, 'You know how you'd be able to nail this album? Move back into your mum's house. Take all your stuff and live your life from there.'\n\"But obviously you can't do that. It would just be too annoying. So what I did instead was make sure I met up with all my friends and did the things I did before this all happened.\n\"That was the creativity behind the album, catching up with my friends.\"\nYou can hear it in the music. There's a playfulness and warmth that was missing from Tinie's second album Demonstration, which found the rapper struggling to come to terms with fame. He symbolically scratched his eyes out on the cover, fearing he'd become too much of a \"personality\".\nOn Youth, he steps back and counts his blessings.\n\"It was such a strange thing to be a British rapper when I started,\" he says. \"People were like, 'Oh, you're rapping with an English accent? Naaaah.'\n\"Now that's changed. Look at the likes of Stormzy and Dave - there's a plethora of British rappers. It's an accepted genre now. It means something to British culture on a mainstream level.\"\nTinie was born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu Jr, and spent his early years in Peckham's notoriously rough Aylesbury estate.\nBut by the time he was 12, his father, a barber turned social worker, and mother, an NHS administrator, had saved up enough money to move the family to the quiet, leafy suburbs of Plumstead.\nPatrick picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology - but was seduced by music after seeing So Solid Crew on TV.\nRap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic.\nHe took a job selling double glazing to fund his early recordings, and emerged as part of the grime scene with tracks like Wifey and Tears.\nSoon he was developing his own sound - a futuristic mix of hip-hop, synth-pop and space-age dub, laced with a wry awareness of rap cliche.\n\"I got so many clothes I keep 'em in my aunt's house,\" he quipped on his breakout hit Pass Out.\nHe acknowledges his musical progression on a new song called Not for the Radio. \"Eight years sitting on top/Hip-hop, grime, then I went pop.\"\nYet for all his chart-busting collaborations with pop stars like Ellie Goulding and Jess Glynne, he hasn't forgotten his roots. \"I listen to grime still, I go to events, I partake in the music,\" he says.\nWhat impresses him most about the new generation of artists is their self-reliance - in particular Skepta and Stormzy, who've hit the big time while recording and releasing songs on their own labels.\n\"Against all the odds, they're setting up their own infrastructure, putting out records, creating their own hype and achieving things that, five years ago, you could only have achieved on a major label,\" marvels the rapper.\nTinie also retains the rights to his music, while licensing it to Warner Music subsidiary Parlophone.\nGrime's success is particularly encouraging because, he says, it \"was almost like the uninvited genre\".\nHe says: \"People have likened it to punk but I feel like, for some reason, it wasn't embraced. It got pushed to the side.\n\"I think that's basically changed now. We get to be ourselves and make hits, just like everybody else.\"\nHe addresses the genre's success on another album track, Lightwork: \"Black boys getting white paper/From the underground, now we're in the skyscraper.\"\nReconnecting with friends while making Youth, Tinie realised that obsessing over his career had robbed him of other experiences. But it's a price he says was worth paying.\n\"A lot of my mates from school are married, some of them have got kids, some of them have got two or three,\" he reflects.\n\"It's weird: I can be sitting with a friend, telling them about all the amazing things I've seen on tour. Like, 'I played in the Maldives in an underwater club!' Or, 'I did the Olympics!' And they'll be sitting there thinking, 'Wow, I'd love to do what you're doing.'\n\"But equally, they can tell you, 'Mate, I just got married. You missed the wedding. And now my wife is expecting her first child.' And I'll be like, 'Wow, you're getting on with your life and it seems like you're really happy.'\n\"But I don't feel I'm missing out. If you ask any musician who's operating at a certain level, you swear your life to your art, if that makes sense.\n\"So I don't want to upset anyone that's reading this - but it's almost like the art comes before pretty much everything else.\"\nTinie Tempah's album Youth is out on 14 April.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

{"document": "Every evening, at an air base in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, coalition spokesman Saudi Brig-Gen Ahmed al-Assiri delivers an upbeat assessment for the media.\nThe narrative has changed little since the opening days of \"Operation Decisive Storm\".\n\"We are achieving our aims,\" says the general. \"We are systematically destroying the enemy's bases.\"\nBut what exactly are those aims and are they being achieved?\nWhen the air strikes began on 25 March the war aims of the Saudis and their allies were simple: reverse the takeover of Yemen by rebels and restore the legitimate president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, to power. Neither of those two aims has been achieved. Yet.\nMr Hadi is stuck in a guest palace in Saudi Arabia, effectively in exile, while his remaining support base withers away in Yemen.\nThe poorly-armed but determined southerners trying to defend the city of Aden from the Houthi northerners grumble that their president fled the country, leaving them to fend for themselves.\nThe Houthis, who began their takeover of Yemen by overrunning the capital Sanaa in September, have certainly taken a battering from the air strikes. But on the ground they have remained largely in control of the whole of western Yemen where the population is concentrated.\nTheir success is due, not so much to any alleged support from Iran, but to the help they are getting from renegade former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has backed them with Republican Guard and other military units still loyal to him.\nThe rebels come from the far north of the country, and as Shia they share the same branch of Islam as only 30 percent of the population; the remainder are Sunnis.\nSo they know they probably cannot hold onto the south indefinitely and will announce a strategic withdrawal once they feel they have made their point, namely that they have survived the onslaught of several air forces and their US-made precision guided missiles.\nThe Saudis have a lot resting on this campaign.\nThe new defence minister, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is only 34 years old and relatively untested.\nIf the campaign fails it will reflect badly on him but more importantly on his father, King Salman.\nSo the Saudi leadership knows it cannot afford to fail in Yemen, not just for fear of instability spilling across their common border but also for what it means for their own credibility amongst the Saudi people.\nPeriodically there are reports of Saudi armour moving closer to the Yemen border, prompting speculation about a ground offensive.\nBut everyone knows Yemen can be a graveyard for invaders.\nIts rugged, mountainous terrain and fiercely territorial tribesmen make it an extremely difficult country to fight in. Ask the Egyptians, the British and even latterly the Saudis, who have all taken casualties there.\nSo any ground incursion by the Saudi-led coalition is likely to be a temporary measure - such as, say, throwing a cordon sanitaire around Aden - to secure a better bargaining position when the political negotiations begin in earnest.\nIran, whose exact role in Yemen is somewhat murky, has called several times for a ceasefire, accusing their regional rivals, the Saudis, of committing genocide there.\nOn Monday, their foreign minister suggested it was time to choose a new government, with Iranian help. The Saudi reaction was apoplectic.\n\"It's an absolute non-starter,\" a Saudi adviser told the BBC. \"The new Saudi doctrine is to have an Arab world free of any Iranian role. It's typical delusional rhetoric coming out of Tehran.\"\nSo how exactly will this war end? In fact, can it end? Probably messily is the answer.\nThree weeks in there are no clear winners or losers, unless you count al-Qaeda which is profiting from the turmoil in the east of the country.\nUltimately, there will have to be a political settlement, a compromise deal that is just about acceptable to all parties, otherwise one side or the other will simply carry on fighting.\n\"The Saudis always wanted a political settlement,\" says a retired Western diplomat.\n\"I can understand why they wanted to do this [campaign] but they need to define victory and that has not been done. Right now the Houthi [rebels] are the ones controlling the narrative.\"\nHowever this ends, Saudi Arabia will be instrumental in Yemen's future. Up until now, it has been one of the country's principal benefactors.\nAlong with other Gulf Arab states, Saudi Arabia has no wish to see Yemen collapse and has poured millions of dollars into the country. If the Houthis were to remain in power it is hard to see that financial tap being turned back on.", "summary": "For almost three weeks the Saudi-led coalition of mostly Gulf Arab air forces has been pummelling Houthi rebel positions across Yemen.", "id": "32284365"}
{"document": "From a team that lays claim to being the first World Cup winner to a side featuring Chris Waddle's son, the qualifying rounds are full of interesting stories.\nThe long journey to the FA Cup final begins on Friday, with 368 teams competing in the extra preliminary round.\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of the more intriguing stories surrounding those qualifying games.\nWith a long history and a famous tradition, the FA Cup is widely regarded as the most prestigious domestic cup competition in the world.\nWest Auckland Town have reached the first round proper of the competition on three previous occasions, but supporters speak most fondly about their biggest claim to fame - being the first winners of the World Cup.\nThe team from the small County Durham village were invited to participate in the inaugural Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy in 1909. It was one of the first international tournaments in world football and, consequently, was considered by some as the first World Cup.\nWest Auckland Town won the tournament, and repeated that feat two years later, beating Juventus 6-1.\n\"There was nothing about it in the English press at the time, but it was massive news in Italy and all over the newspapers,\" says the club's general manager Stuart Alderson.\n\"We got to keep the trophy and we had it on display until 1994, when it was stolen. We have a replica now, and people still come from all over the world to see it.\"\nWest Auckland begin their pursuit of FA Cup glory at Lancashire-based side Nelson, a team which also boasts a proud history, having been the first English side to beat Real Madrid in Spain.\nThey were a league side during the 1920s, rising to the old Second Division - now the Championship - in 1923, beating the likes of Leeds and Manchester United.\nIn preparation for their first campaign at that level, they opted for a pre-season tour of Spain, where they beat Real Oviedo 2-1 and Real Madrid 4-2.\n\"Everybody is well aware of the team's history in Nelson,\" manager Mark Fell said. \"The story of beating Real Madrid has been passed from generation to generation.\n\"This club has a rich history and it is our job to make this generation proud of their team.\"\nWhen the teams are read out for Staveley Miners Welfare's tie against Worksop Town on Friday night, there could be a very familiar name among them.\nJack Waddle, the 20-year-old son of former England winger Chris, recently signed for Worksop, the side his father played for 15 years ago.\n\"Jack is very much following in his father's footsteps,\" Worksop secretary Paul Stacey said. \"He missed our first two games through injury, however I believe he is in the squad for the FA Cup game.\"\nChris Waddle played in two FA Cup finals at Wembley - losing one with Spurs in 1987 and another with Sheffield Wednesday in 1993.\nWith a World Cup winner and the son of an England winger involved, there is already an international feel to the FA Cup, but that is heightened by the inclusion of FC Romania. It is not the country, of course, but a team named after it.\nFormed by Romanian Ion Vintila and his friends eight years ago, Hertfordshire-based FC Romania have progressed a great deal since playing their first competitive fixture against a team called Beating Chastards.\nThey shot up seven leagues in eight seasons, turned semi-professional this year and have even had a former international footballer on their books.\nClaudiu Raducanu, capped twice by Romania, previously played for Espanyol in Spain and Romanian side Steaua Bucharest, for whom he scored against Southampton in the 2004-05 Uefa Cup.\nHe left in the summer but Vintila has not ruled out the possibility of him returning. The prospect of an FA Cup appearance may prove a tempting proposition.\n\"The FA Cup is the oldest competition in football, and it was always our goal to play in it,\" says Vintila. \"We usually get around 80 to 100 people at games, but hopefully 500 will come down for this game.\"\nFC Romania, making their FA Cup debut, play Haverhill Rovers in the extra preliminary round this weekend.\nAs a child, James Phillips used to dream of guiding a non-league side to FA Cup glory as he played Championship Manager on his computer. On Saturday, the 22-year-old Romsey Town boss will not only get to live out his dream, but he'll also be making history as the youngest manager in the competition's history.\n\"I was one of those sad people after school who was sat there for hours playing Championship Manager,\" Phillips told BBC Sport. \"I always used to try to take a really small club up through the leagues. From a really young age that got my interest going. Now I'm doing it in real life.\"\nPerhaps winning the award for the most unusual name, and statistic, is Billingham Synthonia - the only team in England named after an agricultural fertiliser.\nThe Synners most famous player is Brian Clough. The former Derby County and Nottingham Forest manager made four appearances for them, scoring three goals in the 1952-53 season before he went on national service.\nOn Saturday, the team named after fertiliser host Durham City. It could make for an interesting tie if they progress and are drawn against West Allotment Celtic in the preliminary round...\nNever mind dreaming of a Wembley final appearance, the players at one club have their eye on another prize for doing well in the FA Cup - £15 kit bags.\nSporting Khalsa host Pegasus Juniors and, if they win to progress to the preliminary round, a bag sporting the club's emblem is all theirs.\n\"That's the joys of the FA Cup at grassroots level,\" Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe told the FA.\n\"The pros are fortunate enough to get to the quarter finals, semi-final and final - we are just looking to win one game so I can splash the cash and buy the lads a £15 bag each.\"\nEllesmere Rangers have been involved in the FA Cup every year since 2008-09, but they got into this season's edition by the skin of their teeth.\nThe Shropshire-based team compete in the West Midlands League Premier Division - the 10th level of English football -  and qualified under the FA's points per game system, which rewards those clubs who miss out on automatic qualification with a place in the competition based on their form across the previous season.\nEllesmere qualified in the final slot, effectively making them entry number 736 - the last team in the hat.\n\"We finished 11th last season so we didn't expect to get in this year,\" says club secretary John Edge. \"It really is a big boost for the club because the prize money can help you through a whole season.\"\nOn 30 May, 2015, the FA Cup trophy will stand on a pedestal at a packed Wembley, but its journey begins in more humble surroundings.\nThe trophy will travel to Gloucestershire on Saturday, to the town of Fairford, whose team begin their FA Cup journey with a home tie against Knaphill.\n\"It is a huge day for the club,\" said committee member Chris Tanner. \"Everyone at Fairford is looking forward to the game and to have the FA Cup coming to town is quite special.\n\"The FA Cup generates tremendous interest for clubs both in the professional game and non-league and Saturday will be no different.\n\"Perhaps some won't have realised the FA Cup starts in August.\"\nThe Football Association has quite a job on its hands to make sure all extra preliminary round results are accurate, and that teams do not field ineligible players.\nIn previous years, the home club would report results by voicemail message, which would then have to be decoded by the FA and Press Association before the result could be confirmed and later published. These days the system is set up to be more efficient.\nThe FA sends out an automated text message to each club 15 minutes after kick-off, which explains how the result needs to be reported by text simply by replying to the message. The result and attendance is then published automatically on receipt by The FA of the incoming text message.\nIn order to avoid clubs fielding ineligible players, both teams are required to complete an official team sheet, which is then inspected by a match official, prior to a tie taking place.\nThe above are just a few of the unique tales to come from this year's FA Cup, but we want to hear your FA Cup story.\nDo you have an interesting tale to tell about your team's exploits and do you have any pictures that best sum up the magic of the cup?

But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable.\nI couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women.\nThese feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity.\nThey are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border.\nBut elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality.\nAl-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back.\nPerhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax.\nAt Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: \"Oh, I thought you were carrying guns.\"\nAnd yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon.\nFor two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy.\nBut Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya.\nThen, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast.\nTroops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with \"friendly\" warlords.\nSince then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya.\nRevenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere.\nThen there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation.\nIt has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast.\nAnd then there is Greater Somalia.\nIt is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa.\nAl-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges.\nBy attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area.\nNot that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite.\nYes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town.\nSurely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support.\nBut overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.", "summary": "\"Now I'm okay,\" was about all Cynthia Terotich could manage, as she sat in the casualty ward in Garissa's hospital.", "id": "32189288"}

{"document": "When The Beatles first performed at the Cavern on 9 February, 1961, it was so low key it wasn't even advertised.\nA year and a half, and 292 performances, later, the group was set for stardom and the Cavern would become one of the world's most famous clubs.\nWhile both Lennon and McCartney had already played the club as The Quarrymen, the un-advertised lunchtime session was George Harrison's first appearance at the Cavern.\nThe club's lunchtime sessions were popular with young city centre office workers and many would take sandwiches to eat while watching the groups.\nThe current Cavern has organised a day of events to mark the anniversary and is inviting regulars from the early 1960s to attend. The day of live Beatles music starts with a lunchtime session at 1300 GMT.\nA 40-metre long light installation is being created across Mathew Street, called Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It will create a ceiling of light along the Cavern Quarter area.\nThe original Cavern had started life as a jazz venue in 1957 but by 1961 it was moving towards rock and roll - driven more by plain economics than any change in musical taste.\nPromoter Sam Leach was instrumental in transforming the Cavern's music policy away from the jazz favoured by owner Ray McFall.\nMr Leach said: \"It was a good club and it was exciting.\n\"Ray McFall hated rock and roll. On March 11th 1961, I did the Iron Door (a rival Liverpool club)  - I did an all night session and it got 1,800 people, that night the Cavern had 50 people in, more musicians than fans.\n\"Ten days later...Ray gets the message and he turns over to rock and roll at night. Up until then The Beatles only played at lunchtime.\"\nThe Beatles had played other Merseyside venues since returning from Hamburg in late 1960, but it was at the Cavern that they would cement their reputation as one of the city's top rock and roll groups.\nMany who saw The Beatles at the club claim that was where they were at their best as a live outfit. Mr Leach's first taste of The Beatles was at a venue in Huyton.\nHe said: \"When I first saw them in Hamilton Hall as soon as they started playing, I was just gobsmacked.\n\"The sound didn't just go over you it went through you.\n\"John Lennon started with Slow Down and Paul did Hippy Hippy Shake, Stuart did Wooden Heart, Pete Best did Matchbox. The sound was so powerful, it seemed to reverberate around the hall.\n\"We more or less took American rock and roll and sent it back at them improved. We gave them better sound, which was Merseybeat.\n\"Make no mistake the Cavern has become the most famous club in the world.\n\"It makes me smile when they say: 'The Cavern where it all began' - they were the last ones in. But it was an exciting club.\"\nIn November 1961, record store manager Brian Epstein saw The Beatles at the Cavern and soon after became their manager.\nA record deal with Parlophone would follow but not before the band's sound and image had been subtlety changed.\n\"The Beatles were the best rock band on the planet\", Mr Leach remembers.\n\"Eppy [Brian Epstein] took them and he groomed them, and took all that rawness out of them, and fair enough it worked. But I know John didn't like it because John was an out and out rock and roller.\n\"Paul was sensible he knew you had to sort of bend a little bit and become a bit more showbiz. So he went along with Epstein and really, Paul was right.\"\nPaul McCartney returned his roots at the Cavern in December 1999 to play a one-off concert, but it wasn't on the same stage that he had played from almost 300 times in the early 1960s.\nThe original Cavern club closed in 1973 and was demolished to make way for a ventilation shaft for Liverpool's new underground railway loop line. The shaft was never built and the current Cavern club is recreated across three quarters of the original site, using many of the old club's bricks.\nExactly three year's after their first Cavern appearance on 9 February, 1964, The Beatles performed on The Ed Sullivan Show playing to a record 73 million people across America.\nBeatlemania had arrived.", "summary": "Fifty years ago, a young group stepped on stage in a dark cellar club on Liverpool's Mathew Street for the first of what would be almost 300 appearances.", "id": "12381875"}

{"document": "If that happens, the ice loss could push up global oceans by 2m, or more.\nThe claim is based on an assessment of the rocks underlying the ice stream.\nScientists tell the journal Nature that should the front of the glacier retreat about 150km from its current position, it will then enter a runaway reversal that takes it 200-250km further inland.\nMost of the big glaciers in the east of the White Continent appear relatively quiescent; Totten is something of an exception.\nIt is experiencing a thinning rate of about half a metre per year, according to the latest satellite measurements.\nPrevious research indicates this is probably being driven by warm ocean water getting under and melting the floating front of the glacier.\nWhat Alan Aitken and colleagues have now done is examine a possible future for Totten if the shrinkage continues.\nThey have used gravity and magnetic data recorded over the entire catchment feeding the glacier to understand its past behaviour.\nThey find that the underlying sedimentary rocks at the modern front of Totten are heavily eroded, as are the rocks in fjords deep in the interior of the catchment. The inference is that these sections are where persistent, moving ice has had time to grind down the geology.\nIt is the mid-region, however, that piques the team's interest. Here, the sediments are relatively thick, suggesting that ice fronts have historically been resident in this section for only short periods.\nThis mid-region is also where the rock bed dips inland - a geometry that glaciologists say is naturally unstable and accelerates any glacier retreat.\n\"What this all tells us is that once the ice margin starts to go back, it goes back quite rapidly to a newer, stable position way inland. And if you do that our modelling indicates you will lose ice equivalent to 1.5-2m of sea level rise,\" co-author Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News.\nThe last time Totten retreated to the deep interior of the France-sized catchment was probably in the Pliocene Epoch, he added.\n\"Three-point-five million years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were in the region of 400 parts per million - so about where they are now. The atmosphere was a couple of degrees warmer than it is now, which is in line with what we expect for the end of this century if we do nothing about it. The Pliocene is where we're headed.\"\nEven so, the timescale for the far retreat inland would be on the order of centuries, on current trends.\nThe international community has of course committed itself to doing something about climate change, promising at the Paris talks in December to try to keep the global atmospheric temperature rise above pre-industrial levels to \"well below 2C\".\nVarious analyses, however, suggest a 2.7C increase is a more likely outcome, based on the voluntary national curbs to greenhouse gas emissions promised at the meeting.\nAnd that variance could be significant, according to research presented at the recent European Geosciences Union meeting in Vienna last month.\nProf Rob DeConto from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, US, has modelled possible ice losses from the Antarctic continent based on the two temperature figures.\nFor a 2C rise, he found minimal change by the end of this century. On the other hand, for 2.7C he identified ice losses equivalent to many tens of centimetres of sea-level rise.\n\"There's threshold behaviour in the Antarctic ice sheet system,\" Prof DeConto told reporters at EGU.\n\"We don't know exactly where that line is, but according to these results somewhere between 2C and 2.7C makes a very big difference.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "summary": "Unchecked climate change could put Antarctica's huge Totten Glacier into an unstable configuration over the coming centuries, a study has warned.", "id": "36327250"}

Businesses had called for clarity since the UK announced it was leaving the EU's tariff-free trading area.\nMinisters said the plans would mean the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of Europe.\nThe newly-published paper says the UK could ask Brussels to establish a \"temporary customs union\" after it leaves the EU in March 2019. During this period it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals, which it cannot currently do as a customs union member.\nOnce any temporary arrangement expired, the paper says the UK would look to agree either a \"highly streamlined\" border with the EU or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all.\nThe plan has drawn a mixed response, with Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer calling it \"incoherent and inadequate\" and \"fantastical and contradictory\". However, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it was \"encouraging\", and the Institute of Directors said it was \"hugely positive step\".\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, tweeted that the idea of \"invisible borders\" was \"a fantasy\".\nMs Sturgeon posted an initial reaction to the customs union plan on Twitter, saying: \"Seems UK gov is back to its daft 'have cake and eat it' approach to Brexit.

{"document": "They say the government is failing to promote back-to-nature schemes which protect lowland homes by deliberately creating floods in the hills.\nThe Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) say upland schemes to slow river flow cost a fraction of conventional flood walls – and should be spread round the UK.\nMinisters back the principle but say the details need to be worked out.\nThe idea of creating floods upstream to prevent floods downstream was a key message from the Pitt Review into the 2007 floods.\nA handful of pilot projects have pioneered cheap small-scale measures like felling trees into streams to slow down the flow, and building earth banks to catch run-off water and allow it to soak away.\nOne low-tech scheme in the hills above Belford in Northumberland cost about £300,000. It was put in place after a study suggested the cost of conventional flood defences would cost £4m.\nBut progress nationally has been slow, with funding a major problem.\nKatherine Pygott, from CIWEM, told the BBC: “Flooding is getting worse with changing weather patterns, but these schemes are taking a very long time and a lot of energy.\n“Projects working with nature to reduce flood risk are needed right across the country but it is complicated with many different organisations involved and it will need political leadership from the highest level to make it happen. So far we haven’t seen that leadership.”\nThe upland schemes are designed to reduce the regularity of flooding, not remove risk completely. Conventional flood defences will still be needed but CIWEM estimates that re-wilding rivers will save ten of millions by reducing the peak flow and lowering the specification for flood walls. The projects should also benefit wildlife.\nPhil Welton, from the Environment Agency, says the UK should aspire to have \"a pond in every field in the areas where flood prevention is needed.\n\"We have got to give incentives to farmers to persuade them to capture water on their land,\" he argues. \"Farmers will lose a bit of land – but these areas are only wet for two to three days a year and quite often they are on bits of land that farmers don't use – boggy areas or buffer strips.”\nIncentives for farmers are one key sticking point. In theory, funds from the Common Agricultural Policy can be used for catchment management but in practice Ms Pygott says that the standard of proof is much higher than for biodiversity projects which can also be supported under the CAP.\n“With biodiversity schemes a farmer simply has to show that he has changed the land in a way that’s expected to benefit wildlife,\" she adds. \"With flood schemes they have to prove what the benefits will be and that’s very hard.\n\"We obviously don’t want to be wasting government money on the wrong projects but with weather patterns changing it really makes sense to take a leap of faith on this and say it’s obvious these schemes are going to help if you get them in the right place.”\nWhile farmers’ union NFU supports the idea in principle, it maintains it is not a \"panacea\" and will not alleviate flood risk in all parts of the country.\n\"It is most beneficial in steeper catchments where rainfall is quickly funnelled into rivers that can result in high peaks in flows,\" its flood adviser Ian Moodie warned. “The measures are less likely to be beneficial within lowland areas such as the Somerset Levels where we’ve seen a lot of flooding in recent years.”\nTaking the pilot schemes into upland areas nationwide will not be easy. CIWEM say thousands of farms need to be visited and surveyed to see where micro-schemes can be placed to protect catchments – a tough demand when Defra and the Environment Agency are shedding staff.\nEnvironment Secretary Owen Paterson told the BBC he was \"passionate about keeping water in the uplands but details of how to do this need to be resolved\".\nCIWEM say the quickest results for back-to-nature drainage will come in areas where land is owned by a few people.\nFor instance, near Pickering in Yorkshire, flood zones are being created and moorland drains stuffed with heather with the co-operation of just three large landowners including the Forestry Commission.\nIt was the need for forestry and farm output which saw the UK’s uplands drained in the first place when the farm department MAFF urged landowners to maximize productivity to overcome the U-boats during the Second World War.\nNearly seven decades later there’s still no concerted nationwide attempt to keep the rain on the uplands where it falls.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin", "summary": "Water experts are calling on ministers to show greater leadership on flooding.", "id": "25752320"}

The odds of winning are only slightly better than the odds of guessing the mobile phone numbers of the next two strangers you see in the street. The UK does not send £50 million a day to the EU.\nBut, as the Reality Check team have been finding out, the chances of winning are staggeringly small.\nThere are a total of 36 games in the group stage of the tournament and 15 knockout matches.\nThe odds of correctly forecasting all 51 games randomly are a sextillion to one.\nNow, your in-depth knowledge of European football may tip the odds more in your favour, but remember you also have to guess which teams will qualify from the group stages.\nThe finals feature 24 teams for the first time and with 16 of them qualifying for the first knockout round, the results are harder to predict.\nEven if you had a 70% chance of getting each one right, the odds are probably about one in 80,000,000 - quite a bit worse than your chances of winning the lottery (45,000,000 to one since you ask).\nVote Leave recognise that the odds are slim but campaign director Dominic Cummings defended the contest, saying: \"We want everyone to have the chance to win the sort of money most people can only dream of, unless they are a banker or a Euro MP.\"\nFor the record, MEPs earn 8,213 euros (about £6,250) per month.\nTo qualify for the prize, participants have to enter their phone number, together with their email and home addresses, with a Vote Leave source admitting it would allow them to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters.\nWill Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger In Europe, described the competition as a \"con\".\nBut Vote Leave's privacy policy allows anyone to \"opt out\" from receiving campaign information \"at any time\".\nOdds aside, Vote Leave have based their competition prize figure on the assertion that the UK sends £50m a day - or £350m a week to the EU. They've been sharply reprimanded for this by Sir Andrew Dilnot, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority for using it. He described it as \"misleading\" and said it \"undermines trust in official statistics\".\nWe've looked into this claim before and concluded that once you allow for the rebate and money that comes back to the UK for things like farming subsidies, the UK sends roughly £23 million a day to the EU.\nThis would be a very tidy lump sum but not nearly as generous as the amount that Vote Leave is offering.\nRead more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate", "summary": "Vote Leave has promised a £50m prize for the person who correctly predicts who they think will win each game of the 2016 European Football Championships this summer.", "id": "36398775"}

We want to join with them, working alongside them, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world.\n\"We are extremely ambitious for this new service.\n\"Where Google's mission is to organise the world's information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand it. We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world.\"\nThe government launched a consultation on the BBC's Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how it will be governed, in July, promising to ask \"hard questions\" about the corporation's size and ambition.\nOther BBC plans include:\nThe director general also said he wanted to enable \"producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere\".\nQuality drama will also be a priority, he said, and the BBC will make \"bigger and bolder series\" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety.\nPhysicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution.\n\"This is not an expansionist BBC\" is perhaps the key political line in today's announcements.  This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is \"imperial in its ambitions\" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers).\nPartnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition.\nThe second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to \"binge\" watch.

{"document": "Scotland's health boards paid more than £20m in overtime and additional pay to some doctors in 2015/16, up from the £14m paid out in 2014/15.\nThe British Medical Association said there were not enough consultants.\nBut Health Secretary Shona Robison said overtime was a \"tiny percentage\" of the overall spend on consultants.\nAnd she said the government was \"determined to eradicate high cost overtime payments in NHS Scotland\".\nThe BBC asked all 186 organisations running NHS hospitals in the UK about overtime and extra payments over the last three years.\nAcross the UK, overtime and additional payments have increased by more than a third, to £168m, in 2015/16 - with one doctor in Lancashire making almost £375,000 in the space of 12 months.\nIn total, 23 NHS trusts had to pay at least one consultant more than £100,00 for extra work, with another 39 paying at least one more than £50,000.\nMuch of the overtime work involves non-emergency procedures designed to meet waiting times targets. It is up to hospitals to negotiate their own rates for extra work, with the most lucrative ones in place for routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.\nConsultants doing overtime in these areas commonly make £600 for a four-hour shift - three to four times what they normally get. Overtime for urgent and emergency work tends to be much lower - around £300 for a shift.\nOf Scotland's 14 health boards, 12 responded to the freedom of information requests. This showed spending going up from £14.27m in 2013/14 to £20.92m in 2015/16.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde paid out the most, with an outlay of £7,749,870 on higher rate payments for additional shifts, while NHS Orkney did not make any payments.\nNHS Grampian had the greatest increase in payments, from zero in 2013/14 to £1.6m two years later.\nThere were also sharp increases at NHS Lanarkshire, from £1.8m to £3.4m, and NHS Lothian, from £1.3m to £2.1m.\nA number of hospitals asked about the payments UK-wide said there was a shortage of consultants, meaning they had to try to get existing staff to do extra work.\nThey also said high emergency-room pressures had led to the cancellation of more routine treatments, increasing the need for overtime.\nA spokesman for the British Medical Association said: \"The fact is the NHS is only paying overtime on this scale because it does not have enough doctors to do the work.\"\nHowever, Scotland's health secretary insisted that consultant staffing was at a record high.\nMs Robison said: \"NHS consultant numbers have increased by almost 43% under this government to a record high level. This spend on overtime represents a tiny percentage of the overall spend on consultants.\n\"We are determined to eradicate high cost overtime payments in NHS Scotland, which is why we have launched a national programme for the effective management of all temporary staffing, to help boards move away from reliance on high cost temporary staff, reduce overall costs and ensure value for money for NHS Scotland.\n\"We have also set up and championed the use of local 'staff bank' systems, which are a pool of flexible NHS-employed staff who fill the majority of short term vacant shifts at NHS pay rates. Work is now underway to develop these local banks into integrated regional and national staff banks to allow greater flexibility across NHS Scotland and minimise reliance on agency staff.\n\"In the meantime the use of overtime and locum staff allows NHS Boards to respond to periods of planned and unplanned absence including long term sickness, unexpected vacancies and maternity and paternity leave ensuring service continuity during these times.\"", "summary": "Growing pressures on hospitals are forcing them to ramp up costly overtime payments to consultants to do extra work, a BBC investigation shows.", "id": "36897564"}

{"document": "Spending reviews - where the chancellor sets out how much each government department can spend for the next three or four years - were introduced by Gordon Brown in 1998.\nGeorge Osborne held his first Spending Review in 2010. His second, which covered a single year, 2015/16, came in 2013.\nWednesday's Spending Review will set departmental budgets for the next four years - up to the 2020 general election.\nMr Osborne says he has now reached a settlement with all government departments. He has played down reports of rows with Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Home Secretary Theresa May, both of whom face big cuts in their budgets.\nHealth, schools, international aid and defence will escape cuts but Mr Osborne has asked unprotected departments to find a total of £20bn in savings as part of plans to balance the government's books.\n(The past spending cut figures are taken from the IFS analysis of the latest Treasury figures for changes to departmental expenditure limits between 2010/11 and 2015/16, taking into account the impact of inflation.)\nCuts since 2010: 24.9%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: The police budget has been cut by 4% a year. About 17,000 frontline police jobs have been lost over the past five years, according to the Police Federation.\nWhat's next: In line for further sizeable cuts, with police chiefs warning that a cut of 25%, at the bottom end of the expected range, could threaten the future of some forces. At least 22,000 jobs will be lost, according to unofficial estimates seen by The Guardian. Home Secretary Theresa May has suggested some forces could share resources. She has also been warned by one of the UK's most senior police officers that cuts on the scale expected could \"reduce very significantly\" the country's ability to respond to a Paris-style terrorist attack. George Osborne has said he is confident the UK would have the resources to respond to such a threat but made clear the police, like all public services, will have to make savings.\nCuts since 2010: 13.5%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Reductions in the size of the army and Royal Navy, delays to fighter jet upgrades, scrapping the Nimrod spy plane and halving the number of jets to be deployed on two new aircraft carriers.\nWhat's next: The chancellor pledged in his summer Budget to meet Nato's target of spending 2% of national income on defence every year, up to 2020. That means spending on defence will rise in real terms - 0.5% above inflation - every year during the Parliament. David Cameron has said this will mean a larger Navy, a larger RAF and a better-equipped Army, with an extra £12bn over the next decade for new equipment and logistical support. The £31bn predicted cost of four new Trident nuclear submarines, which is £6bn higher than was estimated in 2010, is not included in these figures. Chancellor George Osborne is reportedly bidding to take control of that contract, for which there is also a £10bn contingency fund, from the Ministry of Defence. The MoD will also be forced to sell off 30% of the land it owns and shed 30% of its civilian staff as part of £11bn in efficiency savings.\nCuts since 2010: 18.4%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: BiS was ordered to find 25% savings in George Osborne's first spending review in 2010, although in practice the cuts did not turn out to be as severe as that. The university teaching budget took a big hit and dozens of quangos were abolished.\nWhat's next: A likely target for further significant cuts. Business Secretary Sajid Javid has drawn up plans to close down some of its 80 offices and cut its remaining quangos by half to as few as 20, closing seven separate research councils, according to the Financial Times. Some 200 civil servants are taking voluntary redundancy, the paper says.\nCuts since 2010: 34.1%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Spending was slashed by 23% in 2010 and then by a further 10% in 2013, making an overall cut of £2.1bn. This was largely achieved by cutting the number and cost of prison places. There are also plans to cut legal aid and close 91 courts and tribunals in England and Wales, and integrate or merge another 31.\nWhat's next: Justice Secretary Michael Gove has announced plans for nine new prisons, to be funded by selling off old prisons for housing. He will be expected to find significant further savings, which he has said he would like to achieve, in part, by reducing re-offending rates meaning fewer people returning to prison. The Chief Inspector of Prisons has warned about the dangers of overcrowding if the budget is cut further.\nCuts since 2010: 21.6%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: More than half of the savings came from transferring the cost of the World Service to the BBC. There was also a reduction in the number of Whitehall based diplomats and a cut in capital spending.\nWhat's next: The Foreign Office has submitted proposals for budget cuts of between 25% and 40%, according to the Financial Times. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond is said to be concerned about possible embassy closures. There have also been warnings about redundancies at Foreign Office HQ. However, the department is to boost funding to the World Service by £34m in 2016-17, spending £85m in each of the following three years.\nCuts since 2010: 30.7%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: There were big cuts in administration costs and a 30% cut in the budget of Arts Council (England).\nWhat's next: Likely to be further cuts to arts funding with the National Lottery expected to make up shortfalls. Free museum entry likely to remain protected.\nIncrease since 2010: 7.3%\nWhere 2010-2015 increases went: Health is a protected department. The government pledged to increase funding for the NHS in England, in real terms, (which means the amount spent on it went up by more than the rate of inflation) every year between 2011 and 2015. The Department of Health says it met that pledge through a 5% real terms increase. At the same time the NHS has had to find billions in efficiency savings and the Department of Health was expected to save £200m itself in 2015-6.\nWhat's next: George Osborne has set about fulfilling the Conservative manifesto pledge of increasing the funding for NHS England by £8bn in real terms as demanded by the boss of NHS England Simon Stevens. By 2020-21 the total budget will be £119.6bn, a rise of £8.4bn once inflation is taken into account. The increases are front-loaded, with frontline NHS services getting a £3.8bn, above-inflation cash injection next year. But details of what is happening to other areas of health spending, such as staff training budgets and the money held by councils to pay for public health schemes from stop smoking clinics to sexual health service, has not being released yet. Doubts also remain about what protection social care will get. The chancellor is understood to be considering allowing local authorities to increase council tax by 2% to pay for care.\nCuts since 2010: 6.4%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Schools budgets are protected but the rest of the department's spending is not - capital spending, on new buildings and equipment, has been cut, as has post-16 education and early years. Spending on the four-to-16-year-olds schools budget went up by 3% while cash spending per pupil rose by 6%.\nWhat's next: The government has again vowed to protect cash spending per pupil although no details have been revealed. But experts say upward pressure on school budgets from growing pupil numbers and pay demands will mean a growing strain on resources. There had been questions about the free school meals for all infants policy, but David Cameron has ruled out that being axed.\nIncrease since 2010: 24.1%\nWhere 2010-2015 increases went:  Justine Greening's international development department is protected from cuts and has seen its budget increase year-on-year, with most of the extra cash going to aid agencies rather than projects run by the UK government.\nWhat's next: The government will continue spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid in line with the UN target. although critics will be keeping an eye out for expenditure in other departments being re-categorised as international aid. In a change of policy, half of all Dfid's budget will be spent in \"fragile\" countries and regions, including the Middle East and South Asia, each year between 2016 and 2020. There will also be an extra £300m a year for the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund by 2020 while funding for developing countries to deal with climate change will double over four years.\nSeparate welfare and pensions budget: £216bn\nCuts since 2010: 35.8%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015:  More than £21bn has been cut from the welfare budget. Controversial cuts to housing benefit, dubbed the \"bedroom tax\" by critics, and a £26,000 cap on the total amount households can claim affected relatively small numbers of people. The biggest savings were achieved through cash freezes to child benefit and changes to how working age benefits are increased each year, as well as a 1% limit on most benefit rises.\nWhat's next: The Treasury is seeking a further £12bn in cuts to welfare spending by 2018/19. It has now reached a deal with the Treasury, although the details have yet to be announced. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith appears to have seen off an attempt by the Treasury to make his department swallow the £4bn cost of measures to ease the impact of cuts to tax credits. This would have been achieved by cutting work incentives offered through the new Universal Credit. Mr Duncan Smith is reported to have threatened to resign over the issue but sources say the dispute is now over.\nBudget increase since 2010: 14.3%\nWhere 2010-2015 increases went: DECC is not a protected department so you would expect its budget to have been slashed. But 2013 measures to ease energy bill increases by adjusting green levies meant it went up overall during the last Parliament. There were also big investments in carbon capture and storage technology.\nWhat's next: DECC will not get such an easy ride this time. It has reached an agreement with the Treasury, expected to be around 21%, although the full details have yet to be announced. The biggest chunk of its budget goes on nuclear decommissioning - and that can't be touched. So it can expect cuts of 46% in its other activities in 2017/18 before spending increases again, according analysis by the Green Alliance. Remaining budgets for green subsidies are likely to be in the firing line. It has already begun a job cuts programme, according to the Financial Times.\nBudget increase since 2010: 4.9%\nWhere 2010-2015 increases went: The Cabinet Office was hit with a 33% core budget cut in the 2010 spending review, which it achieved through efficiency savings and a freeze on Royal Household spending. But the vast majority of its budget is taken up by the Security and Intelligence agencies, which have seen their budgets increase significantly in recent years.\nWhat's next: The Cabinet Office is something of a special case as it covers so many different functions across the whole of government, including driving through efficiency savings. It has now reached a spending deal with the Treasury. The details have yet to be revealed but Chancellor George Osborne has promised an extra £1.9bn a year for cyber security as part of a 30% increase in the counter-terrorism budget.\nCuts since 2010: 29.9%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Defra was one of the biggest casualties of the 2010 spending review. The 2013 floods did change the picture slightly, with billions in extra capital investment in flood defences promised. But the department was still asked for find an extra £83m in savings in 2015-6.\nWhat's next: Defra was one of the first departments to \"settle\" its funding with the Treasury. It is one of four departments to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30%. How much of a hit Defra will take has yet to be revealed. But its capital funding has yet to be announced, with the Treasury pledging to back flood protection.\nCuts since 2010: 13.4%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Had to make cuts to running costs but big capital projects such as Crossrail and HS2 got the go-ahead. It was asked to find an extra £545m in savings in 2015-6, the largest of any single department - the bulk coming from selling off land adjacent to King's Cross station.\nWhat's next: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured above, settled early with the Treasury. His department is one of four to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30%. How much of a hit each department will take has yet to be revealed. But, again, capital spending is not included and the government says it wants to spend £100bn on infrastructure upgrades over the period.\nCuts since 2010: 51%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: DCLG took the biggest hit of any department, in percentage terms, in the last Parliament. The communities-focused part of its budget was cut in half and direct grants to local government fell by 27% in real terms between 2011 and 2015. A further £230m in savings was sought in 2015-6 although the department said this did not affect any existing programs.\nWhat's next: Communities Secretary Greg Clark, pictured above, was one of the first cabinet ministers to settle with the Treasury. His department is one of four to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30%. How much of a hit each department will take has yet to be revealed. And this figure does not include the revenue grant for town halls, which is determined on an annual basis.\nCuts since 2010: 29.9%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Capital spending was cut by 30% and savings made in other areas.\nWhat's next: Not surprisingly, given it is his department, George Osborne has already reached a deal with the Treasury. It is one of four to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30%. How much of a hit each department will take has yet to be revealed.\nThe Treasury also oversees HM Revenue and Customs, which means it will have to find a way of saving up to £4bn to reduce the impact of tax credit cuts after the House of Lords rejected them. HMRC has reached an agreement with the Treasury on a cuts programme, which will see savings made through the \"digitisation\" of the tax system and the closure of \"low value\" programmes.\nCuts since 2010: 8.5%\nThe majority of public spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is calculated using the Barnett formula - a system of grants allocated according to the population size of each nation and which powers are devolved to them. When the UK government increases or decreases funding for departments such as health and education in England, the Barnett formula is used to decide how much devolved governments will receive.\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: The Scottish Barnett block grant fell £1bn in cash terms between 2009/10 and 2011/12, from £29.7bn to £28.7bn. The grant is currently just below 2011/12 levels, in cash terms.\nWhat's next: The Scottish Office, Northern Ireland Office and Welsh Office have all reached a deal with the Treasury. The details have yet to be revealed but they are part of a package of cuts to seven departments that average 21% in total by 2020.\nThe Scottish government has promised to protect health spending which could force ministers to make deeper cuts in other areas. But it will have more scope to raise additional revenue through the partial devolution of income tax and VAT, and the whole of Air Passenger Duty.\nThe next block grant will be cut to compensate the UK government for tax revenues lost through the devolution of Stamp Duty land tax and landfill tax.\nCuts since 2010: 8.7%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015:  Welsh government finance minister Jane Hutt says £1.3bn has been \"taken out of vital public services\" over the past five years.\nWhat's next: Planned cash increases to NHS spending will be reflected in a funding boost for the NHS in Wales and this could offset other cuts. Non-devolved departmental spending in Wales will fall by approximately £260m by 2018-19: this is a reduction of 16% in real terms, according to an analysis by The Institute for Welsh Affairs.\nCuts since 2010: 8:8%\nWhere the axe fell: Stormont's spending power was cut by more than £1bn, in real terms, between 2010 and 2015, although health and schools spending was protected.\nWhat's next: The Northern Ireland executive expects a continued real-term decline in funding levels, mirroring the UK-wide squeeze. The Northern Ireland Office has reached a spending agreement with the Treasury.\nPresented by Chancellor George Osborne, the Spending Review sets out what government spending will be over the next four years, while the Autumn Statement is an annual update of government plans for the economy.\nExplained: Which government departments will be affected?\nAnalysis: From BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg\nSpecial report: Full in-depth coverage of the Spending Review and Autumn Statement\nWatch: The BBC's TV coverage begins on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel at 11:30 GMT, with BBC Radio 5 Live coverage from 11:55 GMT", "summary": "Public services face another round of budget cuts in Chancellor George Osborne's Spending Review on Wednesday - but which departments are likely to be the winners and losers?", "id": "34790102"}

France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.\nIt is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.\n\"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\nBut there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\nGordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.\n\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\n\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\nIf the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\nIt will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\nOne long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\n\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\nIn his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\n\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\nUnless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\nBut if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\nJust a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\nWhen it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\nFor its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\nIn 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.\nThe overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.\nMarket research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\".\nEven so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\nThese are:\nAn inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\nA Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.\n\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\n\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\nThe EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\nBut the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\n\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\n\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\nIf you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\nOf course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\nOpticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\nThey also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\nBut for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\nOn worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\nFor the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.\nWith cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.\nWill customers benefit as well?", "summary": "Since their impending merger was announced in January, there has been remarkably little comment about the huge proposed deal to combine Essilor and Luxottica.", "id": "38899892"}

Production is now halted and the gate is being guarded by policemen.\nIndia's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki was one of the first car companies to set up here. Many ancillary units followed them. Now Haryana is considered one of the foremost car-making hubs in India.\nBut labour issues have long been a concern here. Companies have been asking for India's old labour laws to be reformed for some time now.\nThere has been a lot of speculation about what triggered these protests, but most observers believe it is linked to a disagreement over wages and employee contracts.\nMost industries get around the strict labour laws by employing more contract labourers or outsourcing to an agency.\nManagers and workers blame each other for starting the clashes, which follow months of troubled labour relations.\nThe violence at the vast factory in Haryana state is believed to have erupted after an altercation between a factory worker and a supervisor.\nWorkers reportedly ransacked offices and set fires at the height of the violence. It escalated when they tried to take disciplinary action against the employee as other workers protested and blocked all exit gates, preventing senior executives and managers from leaving the factory.\nThe union denied responsibility for the violence and told local media that it was triggered by \"objectionable remarks\" made by the supervisor\nDozens of staff, both management and shop-floor workers, were taken to a nearby hospital.\nMaruti company officials have also told the BBC that more than 50 senior manager level staff are still in hospital. The manager who died has been named as Awinash Dev, a human resources official.\nSecurity has now been tightened at the plant, which employs more than 2,000 people and produces more than 1,000 of Maruti's top-selling cars every day, accounting for about a third of its annual production.\nMaruti Suzuki, a joint venture between Maruti and Japan's Suzuki Motor Corporation, has a 50% share of India's booming car market.\nIt has been hit by a series of strikes since June 2011, when workers went on a 13-day strike demanding the recognition of a new union.", "summary": "At least 90 people have been arrested after violent clashes between workers and managers at a Maruti Suzuki factory near the Indian capital, Delhi.", "id": "18897752"}

She has been five years in recovery though, and now works with charity and support services provider CAIS, trying to help users who want to go into recovery.\nFew know Wrexham's drug scene better than her, and she does not believe the number of drug users in Wrexham has increased in the last decade. Nor does she believe Wrexham's drug problem is any worse than any other comparable town.\n\"I think it's everywhere,\" she said. \"This problem is everywhere in all towns. Some are just hidden more than others.\"\nWhat has changed dramatically though, is the type of drugs many people are now using. New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) - some of which were formerly known as so-called \"legal highs\" - are now the choice drug of many users.\n\"People are taking that (NPS) more than they're taking heroin,\" said Lisa.\n\"Heroin's dropping, crack cocaine is dropping and the NPS in increasing. I believe it's because it's cheaper, the quality's better - the quality of that man-made drug is better.\"\nLisa also describes NPS as \"sociable drugs,\" which users tend to take with others. Often, she says, users congregate together to take the drugs, making the problem more visible, and possibly creating a perception drugs use is rising.\nNPS are typically much cheaper than heroin or other drugs, and can be bought, Lisa says, for about Â£5. She also knows of some users buying single-hit \"one-pops\" for as little as Â£1.\nDespite their price, she says the NPS are frighteningly strong - often more powerful than heroin.\n\"They are stronger. From the effects we're seeing with people, they are definitely stronger, and that's why a lot of heroin users are now swapping to the NPS.\"\nShe says some users are left \"zombified\".\n\"They don't know where they are; they don't know their own names. The first 10 minutes...they could easily walk out in the road. It really does dislocate them.\"\nLisa says that on average, a new batch of NPS hits Wrexham's streets every three weeks. They bear new names, and the effects on users often differ. Black Mamba is one of the better-known substances available in Wrexham.\nThe latest - which began to emerge a fortnight ago - is called Triple X. You know when a new batch hits the streets, she says, because users look like zombies as they adjust to the new effects. Some then develop a tolerance to it - until the next release comes along.\nThe constant release of new substances presents huge challenges for those trying to combat their effects.\nCarry Burton is a harm reduction manager with the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. She helps run a mobile outreach service for users.\nAsked how worrying the new trend is, she says: \"Certainly for us as a health service, it does pose serious concerns. We are worried about people's health. We are concerned about people's safety. For heroin users, if they overdose on heroin we have Naloxone that we can give to save lives. We can't do that with new psychoactives, so we have to find alternative interventions.\n\"We are...very keen to try and keep people healthy, but how best to do that still remains a bit of a question mark really for us all.\"\nShe believes other towns of a similar size probably experience similar problems to Wrexham. However, in north Wales - with the exception of the \"odd little pocket here and there\" - the harm reduction team are only witnessing the rise of NPS in Wrexham.\nSome believe that could be because Wrexham has a relatively high concentration of charities or service providers which help drug users, homeless people, or others in need.\nDave Jolly, North Wales Police's chief inspector for the Wrexham area, says: \"I think Wrexham is unique from the point of view of the visibility.\"\nHe adds: \"I think what you've got now is a collective group of about 47 men and women who are generally moving from one service provision to another within their day...predominantly they hang around the town centre, so their visibility is enhanced.\"\nWhile Lisa from CAIS believes many heroin users are now switching to NPS, Chief inspector Jolly says he knows of heroin users who are trying Black Mamba and \"shunning it\" because they don't like the \"adverse reaction\".\n\"If they're running away from it, then clearly there's something about it that's very sinister.\"\nHe admits the problem with NPS is probably going to get worse for Wrexham and other areas. A \"joined-up approach\" between health professionals and other services providers, supported by police, is what is needed to combat the problem, he says, and to try and \"understand why these people are doing what they're doing\".", "summary": "When pictures of people apparently high on drugs in Wrexham's bus station were posted on social media earlier this month, it prompted claims by some the town has a major drugs problem.", "id": "39343444"}

{"document": "The choice of a running mate is one of the most crucial decisions a candidate will make during a presidential run.\nHe is looking for a number two who can balance his weaknesses, appeal to new voter constituencies, persuade independent voters to give him a second look, and campaign effectively on his behalf.\nAll the while, Mr Romney will need a partner who will not outshine him on the stump or otherwise detract attention from him.\nThe perfect VP pick will also need to convince voters he or she is ready to assume the presidency if anything happens to Mr Romney - to be just a heartbeat away from the Oval Office, as the American political adage goes.\nAs Mr Romney nears a decision, here are some of the top possibilities:\nPaul Ryan, 42, has made a name for himself as the top Republican on budget issues, calling for a dramatic reduction in entitlement programmes and other government spending and in taxes.\nThe Wisconsin congressman, chairman of the House Budget committee, is seen as a persuasive surrogate with the capacity to take the Romney campaign on the offensive on issues that are likely to dominate in this election year - such as jobs, the economy and the deficit.\nHe is also a staunch conservative from a state that both parties consider to be up for grabs in the coming election.\nSince becoming chairman of the House Budget committee in 2007, Mr Ryan has worked on shaping an alternative vision for the federal budget.\nBut Mr Ryan's budget proposals are seen as so severe and conservative that they could pose a problem for Mr Romney among independent voters less keen to slash taxes and cherished social programmes.\nMr Ryan studied at Ohio's Miami University and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1998 at the age of 28. He is currently serving his seventh term.\nRob Portman, 56, is a veteran of Washington, having served in the House of Representatives for 12 years and in White House roles under both Presidents Bush.\nIn selecting him, Mr Romney would hope to pick up votes from the crucial battleground state of Ohio, while also having a competent veteran of Washington on the ticket.\nBut Mr Portman's strengths are also his weaknesses. Often portrayed as dull, he brings little excitement and pizzazz to the ticket. His years in Washington would detract from Mr Romney's effort to run as a political outsider. And his role in the second Bush White House could turn off both independent voters and hard-core fiscal conservatives angered by Mr Bush's expansion of government spending and his widening of the federal budget deficit.\nMr Portman was born in Cincinnati and educated at Dartmouth College and the University of Michigan law school. Later, he worked in legal roles in George Bush Sr's White House. He served in the US House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, when George Bush Jr appointed him US Trade Representative.\nIn 2006, Mr Bush appointed him director of the Office of Management and Budget, a role in which he helped formulate White House budget and tax policy. He left that job in 2007.\nIn 2010 he was elected to the Senate, succeeding Republican George Voinovich.\nTim Pawlenty, 51, is seen as a \"Sam's Club Republican\" for his supposed appeal to working and lower-middle class voters (Sam's Club is a chain of giant discount stores run by Wal-Mart).\nMr Pawlenty made his own brief run for the Republican nomination, but quit the race in 2011 before a vote was counted when he failed to gain traction with voters or the media.\nHe could help balance Mr Romney's wealthy, patrician image and certainly brings enough political experience to the table. Currently without a full-time job, he has been an effective surrogate for Mr Romney on the campaign trail, and the men get on well personally.\nBut he is seen as lacking charisma, and he does not bring to the ticket a geographic constituency - Minnesota is a solidly Democratic state, having last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 1972, and before that, in 1956.\nMr Pawlenty has also broken from current Republican orthodoxy on a number of issues, including on energy and environmental policy (although he later renounced his backing for \"cap and trade\" plans), and with a call for universal health insurance for children.\nMr Pawlenty grew up in a family of modest means in South St Paul, the son of a trucking company worker. He studied law at the University of Minnesota and was elected to the state House of Representatives from a suburban district in 1992.\nHe rose in the state House, winning the role of Republican majority leader in 1999. In 2002, he was elected governor. He was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate to John McCain in 2008.\nMarco Rubio, 41, is everything Mr Portman and Mr Pawlenty are not: He is young, handsome, energetic, and a gifted and engaging public speaker and television presence. He is a darling of the conservative populist Tea Party movement, giving him a grassroots appeal Mr Romney's other options lack.\nThe son of Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio could conceivably dent Mr Obama's overwhelming advantage with Hispanic voters. And he could help carry the crucial state of Florida for the Republican ticket.\nBut Mr Rubio also brings drawbacks. At 41, he is younger than Mr Obama was in 2008, and he has less experience on the national political stage than the president did when he launched his run for the White House.\nWhen Mr Rubio was young, his family briefly attended a Mormon church, which would risk alienating some evangelical Christian voters already suspicious of Mr Romney's Mormon faith.\nAnd it is unclear the extent to which Mr Rubio could win Hispanic votes from the Democrats. The majority of Hispanic Americans have a Mexican background and are unlikely to identify with a Cuban American merely because they speak the same language.\nMr Rubio, a lawyer by training, was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000 and rose through the leadership to become House speaker in 2008. In 2010 he was elected to the US Senate.\nBobby Jindal, 41, was the first Indian American elected governor. In choosing him, Mr Romney would hope to broaden his appeal beyond non-Hispanic white voters - or at least soften the party's image among independent voters.\nMr Jindal is a die-hard social conservative and is leading the Republican governors' charge against President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. Those attributes could win Mr Romney support on the Republican right-wing.\nMr Jindal is also fiercely intelligent, attending Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar.\nMr Jindal's first foray into national politics fell flat - he was chosen to give the Republican rebuttal to Mr Obama's 2009 State of the Union address - and he was dismissed as not quite ready for prime-time.\nHis national profile subsequently rose in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when he positioned himself as a bold leader in dealing with the disaster and a critic of the Obama administration's response.\nBefore entering politics, he worked briefly for consulting firm McKinsey and Company in Washington DC.\nWhile in his mid-20s he was appointed to lead the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, and soon was running the national Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Under President George W Bush, he was assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\nMr Jindal was elected to the House of Representatives in 2004, and became governor in 2008.\nJohn Thune, 51, has been seen as a giant-killer by fellow Republicans since he ousted the Senate's Democratic majority leader to claim his seat in the chamber in 2004.\nThe two-term Senator has become a familiar face on US talk shows and is a prolific fundraiser within the party, using extra cash from his own coffers to bolster the campaigns of other Republican Senate candidates.\nMr Thune's staunchly conservative voting record, especially on social issues, could be an asset for Mr Romney, who has struggled to convince his party's base that he is conservative enough for them.\nIn 2010 Mr Thune toyed with the idea of running for president himself but ultimately decided not to, saying in February 2011 that he preferred to serve in the \"trenches\" of the Senate.\nMr Thune is the son of a Norwegian immigrant and hails from Murdo, a small South Dakota town west of the Missouri River. He studied at Biola University in California and the University of South Dakota's business school.\nHe served in the House of Representatives from 1997 to 2003.", "summary": "US Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is expected to name his vice-presidential running mate soon - possibly within days.", "id": "18866453"}

{"document": "But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices.\nThe study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools.\nMany pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations.\nThe rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home.\nTablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group.\nBut researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.\nThe highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.\nThe underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.\nBut Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.\nResearchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.\nBut Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.\nAnd there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.\nDr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.\n\"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,\" she said.\nA separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read.\nIt showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books.\nThe study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people.\nWithin a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet \"addicts\".\nAbout two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos.\nFindings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children.\nIt showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home.\nSimon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools.\nEach pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home.\nUsing these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in \"the current century and not the last\".\nThe benefits are \"difficult to put into league tables\", he says. But they create a \"sense of empowerment\" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel \"trusted and valued\".\nTablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on.\nThe head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.\n\"I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,\" said Mr Mason.", "summary": "Almost 70% of primary and secondary schools in the UK now use tablet computers, according to research.", "id": "30216408"}

{"document": "The latest predictions suggest 49 out of 152 councils will have more pupils than secondary places by 2019-20.\nLocal Government Association analysis of official figures suggests 80,716 new secondary places will be required then.\nThe Department for Education says it has provided local authorities with the funding they need for new places.\nIt added: \"It is now up to them to spend this money efficiently and effectively.\"\nBut the LGA said the crunch in primary schools meant that despite the creation of nearly 90,000 places in the past academic year, and the government committing £2.35bn in places funding for up to 2017, an extra 130,000 were needed before September 2017.\nCouncils were already taking extraordinary measures to deal with the school places crisis, it said. One borough council, Reading, borrowed £35m privately to fund the expansion of 13 of its primary schools.\nEssex County Council topped up its government grants with £39m from its own resources while others have expanded existing schools on to second sites or \"annexes\" to create the places needed.\nDavid Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's children and young people board, said: \"As children move through primary school, securing new secondary places will become a significant issue.\n\"Mums and dads should know councils will do everything they can to create more school places and there are great examples of the work being done across the country.\n\"The challenge for councils is making sure places are delivered on time and in the right places, in a context where some of the decision making about new school places is now in the hands of the government.\"\nThere is a presumption that new schools will be free schools or academies, which are outside local authorities' sphere of influence. It means local authorities do not have as much control over the creation of new schools and places as they once did, although they can invite bids for free schools and academies in their areas.\nIn a report for the LGA on the planning of school places, Mr Simmonds added: \"There are real concerns that the 'easier solutions' have now been taken in the primary sector and dealing with the surge in demand for secondary school places will become more costly and complex.\n\"Councils are now looking to innovative solutions, with Surrey looking to drive down costs by working in a property cluster with neighbouring authorities.\n\"Bournemouth is considering the idea of village schools in former church halls or day centres. Less palatable solutions are also being contemplated, such as bussing children to different areas, building on split sites and even building on the green belt.\"\nThe secondary school places shortage is just a few months a way in a handful of local authorities.\nIn September, three local authorities will be over capacity; by 2015-16 it will be six and 36 in 2018-19.\nCouncils are calling for information on school building funding in five-year cycles and for it to be in one funding pot.\nThey would also like to see the decision-making power on the provision of schools, including free schools, restored to local authorities, along with the power to open council-controlled community schools.\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"We are giving local authorities £5bn to spend on new school places over this Parliament - double the amount allocated by the previous government over an equivalent period.\n\"This funding has already led to the creation of 260,000 new school places, all of which are in areas where there is a shortage of places, and many more new places are planned. We have also confirmed a further £2bn for basic need up to 2017.\"\nHe added: \"Investment in free schools comes on top of the £5bn we are giving to local authorities to spend on basic need. Seven in 10 free school places are in areas of basic need.\"\nNatalie Evans, director of the New Schools Network, which supports the creation of free schools, said: \"Over two-thirds of free schools are being set up in areas where there is a shortage of school places and local authorities themselves are able to invite groups to come forward to set up new schools where that shortfall is particularly acute.\n\"There are many good examples of local authorities working in partnership with groups setting up free schools, but too often authorities perceive these schools as a threat and end up being an unnecessary obstruction to a solution which would work for all.\"\nKevin Brennan, shadow schools minister, said: \"David Cameron's government has displayed a shocking degree of complacency in responding to the need for new school places.\"\nHe claimed two-thirds of all places created by the free schools programme were being diverted away from areas of high or severe need.\nChristine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"Local councils find themselves having responsibility for providing places but with insufficient powers to plan, commission or build schools.\"", "summary": "Urgent action is needed to prevent a shortage of secondary school places in a third of local authorities in England within five years, councils say.", "id": "26562805"}

Thank you to all my team-mates, they've really been there for me every step of the way and I couldn't ask for more.\"\nFrenchman Bardet finished six seconds ahead of Froome to cement second place, while Quintana, who said he \"suffered from allergies\" during the race, will finish third.\nTradition dictates that the man in the race leader's yellow jersey is not challenged during Sunday's largely processional final stage in Paris which is expected to end in a bunch sprint.\nThe 113km route from Chantilly will start in pedestrian fashion with Froome posing for photographs with his team-mates, sipping the obligatory glass of champagne.\nThe stage finishes with nine laps around the centre of Paris and Froome still has to race on the cobbles of the Champs-Elysees and make it across the finish line to be crowned champion for a third time.\nIn doing so, he will become just the eighth rider to win three Tour titles, following legendary five-time winners Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, while joining Philippe Thys, Louison Bobet and Greg LeMond who have all won three.\nFroome is also set to become the first man since Indurain, who won his five titles consecutively from 1991, to successfully defend the title.\nTour director Christian Prudhomme said it was Froome's incredible attacks on stages eight and 11 that were the stand-out moments for him.\n\"There was no surprise because Chris Froome won. But for me it was not the same as in previous years,\" he said.\n\"When he attacked in the Peyrsourde descent it was such a surprise. And he did it again when he went with Peter Sagan in Montpellier.

That gap was extended to 21 seconds as he finished Saturday's stage behind Quintana.\nYates' consolation was retaining the white jersey, which he won by two minutes and 16 seconds ahead of South Africa's Louis Meintjes.\nFroome knew only too well how easily a slip could have cost him dearly on the wet descents in this undulating stage, with his right knee bandaged from a fall in similar conditions on the previous day.\nHe had also suffered road rash on his back and, with the road damp and the downhill finish looking dangerous, he was mindful to stay safely around his team-mates.\nGeraint Thomas, who handed over his bike to Froome on Friday to let his team leader complete the stage, did the job of guiding the yellow jersey up and over Col de Joux Plane, the final mountain of this year's Tour.\nAll of the general classification front runners remained in the peloton with Froome, and the pace was only increased when Roman Kreuziger had leapt from 12th to second overall, causing slight concern among the podium contenders.\nIn the end, Czech Kreuziger was unable to maintain the pace and a large breakaway was whittled down to the pairing of Jarlinson Pantano and Julian Alaphilippe, who were soon joined and passed by 2014 champion Vincenzo Nibali.\nNibali, a favourite to win road race gold at the Olympics next month, was caught by Pantano and a resurgent Izaguirre, and the Basque-born rider descended impeccably to claim his first Tour de France stage win and Movistar's first of this year's Tour.\n\"I think my parents must have been scared watching at home,\" he said. \"I wanted to drop Nibali because I was worried about him in a sprint.

Burkina Faso was the first country to use it for contraception.\nSoré Néimatou, 20, has a boyfriend, and is visiting a family planning clinic in the capital Ouagadougou.\n\"I don't want to get pregnant,\" she says. \"I want to get married first.\"\nShe has never used contraception before, and is given a choice of methods. She opts for the new injection - called Sayana Press.\nThe pre-packaged device means there is no need for health workers to prepare a syringe.\nThe drug is dispensed by simply squeezing a plastic bubble, giving Soré the protection she wants for three months.\nThanks to the design, which is called Uniject, there is no risk of spillages or dosing errors, and because the device cannot be re-used, it cuts out the risk of infection due to needle-sharing.\nThe simplicity of the device means health workers can be trained more quickly too - a vital consideration for developing countries.\nKadidia Diallo, the midwife who helped Soré, says the device is more acceptable for women in rural areas.\nShe said: \"Normally for injections you have to put them in someone's bottom, or the top of their leg, but with this - you use the arm.\n\"That's an advantage for women living in the bush. Many women don't come forward for injections if they have to pull their dresses up - but this is more discreet.\"\nIn early trials women reported less pain at the injection site than with conventional jabs, too.\n18-year-old Rahimata Tiendrébéogo also uses the new device.\n1. Preventing pregnancy-related health risks in women\nEvidence suggests women who have more than four children have increased maternal mortality risk; avoiding unwanted pregnancies, also reduces the need for unsafe abortions.\n2. Reducing infant mortality\nClosely spaced and ill-timed births contribute to some of the world's highest infant mortality rates. Infants of mothers who die as a result of giving birth also have a greater risk of death and poor health.\n3. Helping to prevent HIV/AIDS\nReducing the risk of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV means fewer infected babies and orphans. Condoms also protect against STIs including HIV.\n4. Empowering people and enhancing education\nInformed choices about their sexual and reproductive health gives women enhanced opportunities for education and participation in public life. Children with fewer siblings tend to stay in school longer.\n5. Reducing adolescent pregnancies\nPregnant teens are more likely to have preterm or low birth-weight babies, and babies born to adolescents have higher rates of neonatal mortality.\n6.

Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box.\nWhen skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead.\nInjuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence.\nSt Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals.\nIt was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal.\nOverall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves.\nThere was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead.\nThey might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away.\nSt Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick.\nSwanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory.\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems.\n\"Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well.\n\"Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet.\"\nInverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"We got what we deserved.

{"document": "The response from many in that time has been: \"Let's get on with it.\"\nThat view was shared by the First Minister Carwyn Jones until recently when he altered his opinion and said that we should only start the official Brexit negotiations in the early part of next year.\nMy sense is that the public will be flexible on the timing up to a point, as long as they are given a clear sense of direction.\nThe majority of the political establishment have had to come to terms with the fact that most people ignored their advice to remain. So much for being in touch with the electorate.\nIn conversations with politicians on the remain side since, I have come across a mix of bewilderment, frustration and sadness.\nAnd while people like me spend a lot of time talking and writing about a Welsh political dynamic, on this subject at least, Wales was a carbon copy of England.\nIn stark contrast, those that supported leaving feel vindicated by their campaign, and now believe they are the ones in touch with vast swathes of the population.\nThe referendum result was a devastating indictment of the effectiveness of the billions of pounds of EU funds spent trying to regenerate economically deprived communities.\nThe brutal reality is that those who were most likely to vote to leave lived in communities where most EU money had been spent.\nIt is an extraordinary paradox that raised eyebrows far further afield than Wales.\nThe early stages of a debate about replacement funding has got under way. The Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, a Remain campaigner, led the way by wasting no time in calling for a fundamental change in approach.\nBrexit means the Wales Office may have been given a new sense of purpose, and no more so than in regeneration funding.\nThere's been little meat on the bone but his fundamental premise is that everything has to change, and simply writing a Westminster cheque rather than a Brussels cheque will not cut it.\nThe early signs are that the Wales Office would like to play a part redesigning a new funding system. This will not go down well with the Welsh Government but the come-back from Westminster will be that officials in Cardiff have not done a good job spending the money.\nThere will be something just as fundamental going on regarding financial support for the farming industry.\nThis is a devolved matter so the Welsh Government will have a far stronger sense of entitlement to owning any new system that is introduced.\nSo far there have been plenty of warm words about being in listening mode but not much in terms of concrete proposals, or even ideas, about how to create a new system of agricultural subsidies.\nAnd finally, what about the Welsh economy? Those who express concern about the impact of Brexit are criticised by Leave campaigners for creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nWhen the chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, Jonathan Evans, a fiercely pro-European politician, talked openly to me about recession, there were a number from within his own party who were deeply unhappy at the tone.\nBut how do you then deal with the facts of the matter regarding things like inward investment, when most companies have come to Wales because of our membership of the single market?\nThat was the elephant in the room when the Welsh Government's Economy Secretary Ken Skates spoke about a renewed focus on promoting Wales abroad in light of the Brexit.\nIt is a huge hurdle to overcome, and something that will depend on the effectiveness of the trade deals that Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and Liam Fox will now have to strike with countries around the world.\nAt the same time, there are strong indicators in the Welsh economy, with a continued trend on unemployment in Wales which is remarkable. The norm has been for a number of months that the rate in Wales is lower than the UK average, reversing years of it being the other way round.\nThe underlying strength of the Welsh economy will be tested in the months ahead with the inevitable uncertainty that will accompany the start of negotiations.", "summary": "It has been a month since Wales voted to leave the European Union.", "id": "36867963"}

They say they want more answers and will not give up looking for them.\nSo how can Mexico move on?\nLast week Lourdes Caballero Sanchez took to the streets of the capital with thousands of other Mexicans to call for justice.\nIt was a personal journey for her. Lourdes's 21-year-old brother Israel is one of the missing.\nHer belief that she will find him is unwavering.\n\"I have an intuition that he's still alive. That's why we are here, asking [President] Pena Nieto to give us back our boys,\" she told me.\n\"As a sister, I'm desperate. I miss him, I want to see him. I feel so powerless to not be able to do anything for him.\"\nBut less than 24 hours later, Mexico's Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam delivered a blow.\nHe declared that the students were dead.\nHis team, he said, had interviewed 99 people including members of the criminal gang that he alleges murdered the students.\nBased on 386 declarations from interviewees, 16 police raids and two reconstructions, the conclusion was that the students were killed by the gang and their bodies burned at a rubbish dump.\nThe students' families angrily rejected this scenario.\nAt a press conference held later in the day, one mother stood up and claimed that her son was not missing, he was being held by the government.\nAccusations that the government needs to be called to account have been flying at the same time that the authorities have been trying to draw this questioning to a close.\nThe prosecutor reassured the families the case would not be shut yet, but even President Enrique Pena Nieto has said Mexico needs to move on.\nFor many though, that is not an option.\n\"I can understand the political logic of trying to put this behind the country, but I don't think there are the objective conditions for the country to turn the page,\" says independent security analyst Alejandro Hope.\n\"The government has provided a narrative of what happened but hasn't yet provided an explanation. In the absence of a detailed version of why, this case will not be closed.\"\nThe war on drugs has taken a brutal toll on Mexico in the past decade.\nMore than 100,000 people have been killed and the latest official figures put the number of missing at 23,271.\nThis week, some of the parents of the missing students travelled to Geneva to appeal for help from the United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances.\nMexico's National Human Rights Commission also published a report ahead of the visit.\nCommission President Luis Raul Gonzalez Perez criticised the impunity in Mexican society, which he believes dates back to the 1970s and 1980s: decades when the government and left-wing student groups clashed with deadly results.\nHe gave several recommendations to be discussed at the UN's sessions, one of which was a more systematic database of the missing to understand the true extent of the problem.\nOne of the big concerns among human rights groups is that although many of the suspects arrested have been charged with kidnapping and murder, none have been charged with the crime of enforced disappearance.\n\"It reflects that the Mexican government is reluctant to recognise that in Mexico enforced disappearances occur,\" says Denise Gonzalez, of the Miguel Agustin ProJuarez Human Rights Centre.\n\"They are trying to water down their responsibilities. They are reluctant to recognise that state officials have engaged in enforced disappearances in Mexico.\"\nIn a country used to the high number of dead in the drug war, this case of the Ayotzinapa students has stood out.\nThe feeling, say experts, is that these young men should not be viewed as collateral in a narco-war.\nIt has forced people to push for change.\n\"The majority of Mexicans are now empowered and feel a personal responsibility to change things in the country,\" says John M Ackerman, a law professor at Mexico's National Autonomous University.\n\"This is an invaluable achievement since it implies an historic break with the learned pessimism and passivity encouraged daily on the principal television and radio networks in Mexico.\"\nTheir disappearance has forced the government to make changes, too.\nIn November, President Pena Nieto announced plans to put all local police units under federal control and allow Congress to dissolve local governments infiltrated by drugs gangs.\nBut with mid-term elections later this year, there are question marks as to whether these sweeping announcements will all get voted in.\n\"It was a watershed moment for Mexican society, maybe,\" says Alejandro Hope. \"But a watershed moment for government policy?

It faces two main issues. Firstly, domestically there is the cost of producing steel in the UK which is driven in no small part by energy costs, which are higher than other parts of Europe.\nWe also need to look at the price of steel from around the world. We've seen with the Chinese economy slowing down that more steel is available from China as it's not needed as much there. That steel is making its way here and being bought because it is cheaper, although not the same quality. This is having an impact not just on steel manufacturers in the UK but across Europe.\nTata has made a huge amount of investment including a new blast furnace in Port Talbot which makes it cheaper to produce steel. A lot of the staff - as opposed to the fixed term workers - from Llanwern have been moving there. Processing work will remain at Llanwern.\nWHAT HAPPENS AT LLANWERN?\nHot strip mill - this reheats semi-finished slabs of steel to near melting point and then rolls them thinner and longer and then they are sold as coils. This is being mothballed.\nPickle line - this removes oxide scale which forms when the steel is rolled. It is also rinsed and dried before finishing. One of Llanwern's two lines will close.\nCold strip mill - this process compresses and squeezes steel at room temperature, reducing its thickness and improving its surface and strength. This is being mothballed.\nGalvanising line - a coating of zinc is applied for steel for the car market and products ranging from washing machines to DVD players. Llanwern invested Â£3.6m on its Zodiac line a couple of years ago. This is staying open.\nUK Business Minister Anna Soubry MP said: \"There is no doubt that the steel industry is facing very challenging market conditions, with global overcapacity, steep falls in prices and currency devaluations.\n\"However the government continues to work closely with the sector to provide help where we can.\"\nWelsh Conservatives have labelled reports of huge job losses at Tata's site in Llanwern \"shocking\" and \"devastating\".\nNewport East assembly member John Griffiths said he hoped the announcement was a temporary measure.\n\"We want investment from Tata and a long-term view on expansion and growth here,\" he said.\n\"I'm hoping it is indeed mothballed rather than removed all together.\"", "summary": "Tata Steel is to mothball part of its plant in Newport for the third time in six years with the loss of hundreds of jobs.", "id": "34065990"}

I got two bad breaks with hitting the pin and the wind then caught me out on the putt as well,\" he said.\n\"It was another day where you had to battle, make a lot of pars and pick off the odd birdie here and there.\n\"I feel I can put a 31 or 32 together a couple of times over the weekend and get closer to the leaders.\n\"Hopefully these are the toughest conditions we have played in and hopefully I can go a lot lower over the weekend.\"\nEngland's Danny Willett became the first Briton to win the Masters in 20 years when he claimed his first major 12 months ago - this time there was no cause to celebrate ending another barren run.\nThe Yorkshireman, 29, is the first defending champion to miss the cut since Canada's Mike Weir in 2004.\nWillett began the day at one over par, but his second round got off to a shocking start when he recorded a quadruple-bogey eight on the first.\nTwo more bogeys arrived at the fourth and 11th holes, in addition to a solitary birdie at the 10th, leaving him perilously close to missing the projected cut of six over.\nAnd a bogey on the 18th pushed him to seven over par.\n\"We've had two fabulous years and then you have a little bit of a downturn and it feels like the world is coming to an end,\" Willett said.\n\"Playing Augusta at the weekend would be nice with the good weather coming in, but we had that in our own hands and unfortunately we let that slip.\"\nOther big names who missed the cut include reigning Open champion Henrik Stenson, plus former Masters winners Bubba Watson and Zach Johnson.\nSeven other Britons - Chris Wood, Tommy Fleetwood, Russell Knox, Ian Woosnam, Tyrrell Hatton, Sandy Lyle and amateur Scott Gregory, plus Ireland's Shane Lowry - also failed to make the weekend.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nTwelve months after Bernhard Langer rolled back the years at Augusta, another veteran former champion is dreaming of a fairytale finish.\nFred Couples, who won the Masters in 1992, is three shots behind the leading group after shooting a two-under-par 70.\nThe 57-year-old former world number one is now ranked 1,893, but showed that experience counts for everything at Augusta.\nThe American carded six birdies during a round punctured by a double bogey and two bogeys, and almost holed his approach on the 18th but walked off with a tap-in birdie.\nFind out how to get into golf with our special guide.\n\"I feel like I can play the course well but in conditions like this I feel I have a better chance than if it was sunny and less windy,\" he said.\n\"It would be hard for me to shoot a 68 like some of the better players.

Indeed, some services are still experiencing cuts in services.\"\nNHS England says it has provided £75m to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), but NHS providers fear some of the money has been siphoned off to pay for other services.\nAcknowledging that is a possibility, CCGs have told BBC News they want NHS England to ring-fence the money, specifically for children's mental health services.\nDr Phil Moore, chairman of the NHS Clinical Commissioners Mental Health Commissioners Network, said: \"Despite our commitment to better mental healthcare for young people, it has to be acknowledged that CCGs are dealing with increasingly financially challenging times and a myriad of competing demands on budgets.\n\"This, combined with the fact that children and young people's mental healthcare is in desperate need of heavy investment having historically been treated as a 'Cinderella service', is why we believe this is a rare case where funding should be ring-fenced.\"\nSome trusts say they have seen additional funding - the South London and Maudsley, for instance, said they had received an additional £1.8m from four separate CCGs.\nAnd several CCGs told us they were committed to spending the money on new services.\nBut some children's mental health services are also being cut, especially those provided by councils.\nDr Marc Bush, senior policy adviser at the charity Young Minds, said: \"Our expectation is that overall spending on children's mental health services this year may either be flat or fall slightly in real terms.\"\nFormer care minister Norman Lamb, who helped secure the extra funding, said he was concerned about the lack of progress.\n\"Given the pressure on the whole system including local government, there is a real risk that funding intended for children's mental health ends up elsewhere or simply replaces other funding cuts.\n\"There is an absolute moral imperative to address the very serious underfunding of children's mental health.

{"document": "After another set of economic figures stronger than expected, is this economic pain cancelled, or simply postponed?\nOn that central issue rests the fate of the government's economic policy.\nIf it is pain cancelled that means better real incomes for voters.\nIt means higher tax receipts for the government, lower levels of borrowing and more leeway to spend money on public services.\nAnd, of course, confidence tends to beget confidence.\nIf consumers - the most important drivers of the UK economy - feel the world around them is feeling positive, they tend to spend.\nFor businesses, it is not a lot different.\nLarry Fink, the head of the world's largest asset managers, BlackRock, made an interesting point at the World Economic Forum at Davos last week.\nAsked why consumer confidence hadn't collapsed following the referendum - or at least had recovered strongly after some initial uncertainty - Mr Fink answered that for lots of people who voted for Brexit or who voted for Donald Trump, the victories were not a negative event.\n\"They won,\" he said, simply felt good and kept spending. \"Car sales went up.\"\nFor the UK economy, it is worth considering two points.\nFirst, the gloomy forecasts before the referendum about the possible effects of a vote to leave the European Union were based on Article 50, the mechanism for leaving the EU, being triggered immediately after the vote as David Cameron promised.\nThat could have led to a chaotic departure from the EU and certainly would have created greater economic dislocation.\nSecond, the Bank of England cut interest rates and increased financial support for businesses and banks, soothing market fears.\nThese two points are not enough to explain all of the resilience in the economy, but they go some of the way.\nIn my interview with the chancellor, he admitted that he was now \"more optimistic\" about the process of leaving the EU and the single market.\nHe said that European leaders were no longer in chastising mood over Brexit, that had now past.\nA good deal is on, he said.\nBut, and of course there has to be a but when considering how an economy will perform -  a judgement at its most basic on how a million different decisions by human beings will play out.\nAnd the buts are these.\nThe rate of inflation is increasing as the value of sterling declines.\nThat will affect people's real incomes.\nJobs are being moved out of the UK and on to the continent in sectors such as banking and finance as businesses prepare for Brexit.\nInvestments have been delayed.\nThe UK has, of course, not actually left the EU yet and at the moment is enjoying the stimulus of being in the EU's huge single market with a considerably weaker currency.\nThat goldilocks situation will not last and the chancellor told me of his concerns about business investment.\nIt was the Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, who argued that shocks to an economy can boost growth.\n\"Creative destruction\" may be a little strong to describe the Brexit vote, but innovation can flow when the demands of uncertainty rise.\nAfter Britain fell out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the precursor of the single currency, many predicted that inflation would rise and economic growth would stutter.\nIn fact, the UK economy bounced back, inflation remained in check and the pound rose - after an initial fall.\nThat is not to say that all \"dynamic\" shocks have such an effect.\nThe financial crisis of 2008-09 has negatively affected economic growth for far longer than most expected as the financial services sector contracted rapidly, liquidity disappeared and businesses and consumers paid down debt.\nThat is why it is still too early to say definitively whether the robust state of the UK economy today means the forecasts for economic pain made before the Brexit vote can now be safely ignored.", "summary": "It is the big question swirling around government.", "id": "38754634"}

These things are never made public.\nRemoving Strachan and his coaches and finding replacements would have meant a serious hit to the coffers of an association that has routinely failed to benefit from the millions of euros on offer to those nations who qualify for major championships.\nMoney was not brought up in the statement, but it's inconceivable that it didn't play a part in the discussion.\nWhy pay when the World Cup campaign is already on life support? Why not accept your fate of another doomed mission, let him see out of his deal, save the cash and make a change if one needs to be made when the group fixtures are completed?\nThe SFA couldn't say any of this. It couldn't say it was unwilling, or unable, to pay off the manager, so a different narrative was delivered in its statement, a narrative of \"jam tomorrow\". In this optimistic view of the world, all that was missing was a complimentary pair of pom-poms.\nAll hope of a play-off spot for the World Cup is not lost, they say. They're clinging to the belief that Scotland can garner enough points from a remaining available total of 18 to force their way into the reckoning when the evidence of everybody's eyes tell us otherwise.\nPresenting a scenario of Scotland reeling off win after win required a fair amount of chutzpah for an association that has watched its team concede seven goals in three winless games. And that on top of two years without a competitive win against anybody other than Malta and Gibraltar.\nStewart Regan, the SFA's chief executive, is quoted on how adamant Strachan is about his team's capacity to make up ground in the group. How? He doesn't say.\nRegan points out that the board is convinced that Strachan still has the \"hunger for the challenge\". Hunger shouldn't have anything to do with it when you've failed to qualify for the most easily accessible Euros in history and then sit fifth out of six in a World Cup qualification group with your dreams going up in a puff of smoke.\nScotland will limp on now until March, when they host Slovenia at Hampden. Will we hear again that Slovenia is not a must-win? Will we see anything different?\nWill any new players be considered? Will there be any thoughts about a new formation? Is there likely to be any acknowledgement that, if Scotland keep doing the same things, they are going to end up with the same results?\nThere was no hint of that in Strachan's words in the SFA statement on Thursday. No acceptance that, if he's staying on, he needs to have a major think about what he is doing, who's he selecting and not selecting.\nIf he had spoken about a new beginning then you might - might - be inclined to buy into it. Is he even thinking about it that way? You would hope so, but it's unlikely.\nThere is so much to ponder. Does Scotland have to follow a slavish adherence to 4-2-3-1? Can a solution be found to the absence of dominant centre-backs by converting a full-back or a midfielder? Maybe not, but where are the ideas?\nWe saw a snapshot of Strachan's out-of-the-box thinking when he played Ikechi Anya at right-back at Wembley. What happens when Kieran Tierney and Andrew Robertson are both fit at left-back, along with Lee Wallace and Stephen Kingsley? Is it really one from four there? Does it have to be that way? Where's the innovation, the sense of a manager trying something a bit different?\nAnd what about an enhanced cast of characters on the scene? Aberdeen's Graeme Shinnie, Fulham's Tom Cairney, Brighton's Jamie Murphy, Aston Villa's Ross McCormack, Stoke City's Phil Bardsley and, yes, if he ever starts playing and scoring again, Middlesbrough's Jordan Rhodes.\nThere are others, either on the periphery of the squad or totally divorced from it, that could be looked at properly. Too often, Strachan has been rigid in his thinking and it's done nothing for the team.\nThe tired mantra that \"the players are just not there\" is an entirely bogus argument when all that is being asked is that Scotland become truly competitive, like Northern Ireland. They have decent Premier League centre-halves - from West Brom, who sit 11th - and an impressive midfielder from Southampton - who are 10th - but who have precious little else in terms of quality and, most especially, depth.\nAnd yet, from a squad largely made up of Championship, League One and Scottish Premiership players, Northern Ireland get the kind of results that are beyond Scotland.\nThe attitude of \"no manager could do better with these players\" is fatalism. It's tantamount to a white flag being raised. A quitter's charter, the central tenet of which is blown to the high heavens by what Michael O'Neill is doing with his meagre resources in Belfast.\nThe SFA's statement on Thursday did nothing to challenge the view that a blind faith - or a meek acceptance of failure -  has taken an ever firmer hold of Hampden. When they can't get a draw against Georgia, can't beat Lithuania and can't avoid a drubbing against a moderate team like Slovakia, the idea of Scotland suddenly morphing into a points machine is a hard sell.\nScotland took the most affordable option, but a dwindling number of supporters would agree that it was the best one.", "summary": "In the Scottish Football Association's statement of Thursday evening, there is no mention of money and the kind of cash it would have taken to bring to an end the reign of Gordon Strachan as national team manager.", "id": "38021627"}

{"document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nUsain Bolt's defeat by Justin Gatlin in the last individual 100m he will ever run proved several things: that sport has less time for happy endings than scripted dramas; that time catches up even with someone who has made it his business escaping it; and that even the biggest party can be pooped if you let the wrong characters in.\nEast End dramas need their villains, and on Saturday night in Stratford Gatlin played that role to eye-popping perfection.\nTwice caught doping, once facing a lifetime ban that was reduced first to eight years and then to four, he has long been the anti-poster boy for track and field - lacking any obvious remorse, humility left for others, a frequent swaggering reminder that cheats can still prosper should their legal team find the right angle to work.\nNot all the rancour has made logical sense. Others at these World Championships have returned from suspensions. Russia is banned indefinitely for its 21st century take on state-sponsored doping. Only Gatlin was booed every time he took to the blocks, from heats on Friday morning to semi-finals on Saturday evening and then the final itself.\nSo it was that as he thrust his upper body across the finish line just after 21:45 BST - almost unnoticed in lane eight, outside the peripheral vision of Bolt in four and young American Christian Coleman in five - a wave of shock rolled around the packed slabs of supporters, turning to disbelief, to not wanting to accept what had just happened, to hoping something might suddenly be revealed to make it right.\nGatlin does not find charm easy to access. He slammed on the brakes, jumped to attention and put a single, admonishing finger to his lips, daring the crowd to mock him now.\nRevenge, it seemed, was his - for the catcalls of the past two days, for those who considered him shot at 35, for the mess Bolt has made of his tilts at world and Olympic gold since he returned to competition an older and unapologetic man in 2010.\nAnd then you heard the crowd respond again, first the thousands close to him on the top bend, then those all around the oval track.\n\"Usain Bolt! Usain Bolt! Usain Bolt!\"\nThis was Gatlin's moment of triumph: unacknowledged, unwanted, first mocking and then being mocked in return.\nThe lap of honour? That went to Bolt. The first interview with the in-field presenter? Bolt. The one all the spectators ran down to trackside to touch and to photograph and to seize for selfies? Bolt.\nA victory, but a pyrrhic one. A defeat, but one that was treated like a triumph.\nThe strangest of nights, and a strange truth: Gatlin may have deserved all of that - but he deserved this win too, in its technique and focus if not its ancestry.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn 2015, expected to beat an ailing Bolt at the last World Championships in Beijing. He had led with 15 metres to run only to over-stride with triumph in front of him and let the king cling on to his crown. Now, at an age when his youthful speed has leached away, he ran through the line as if nothing could touch him.\nBolt's reaction to the gun was the slowest of anyone in the race. Five hundredths of a second ceded to Gatlin before a metre had been run, a hundredth more to Coleman.\nWhen the chase came, the invisible bungee cord of old had been replaced by a rope. There was acceleration but no surge. The champion tightened, but not the American kid nor the compatriot 14 years his senior.\nGatlin finished in 9.92 seconds, Coleman in 9.94, Bolt in 9.95. Never before had the 30-year-old Jamaican run so slowly in a major final. In this same stadium, five golden summers ago, he had run 9.63. You can't keep stopping the clock. One day it will stop you.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe World Championships have defined Bolt and given him a simple narrative.\nBerlin 2009: his world record of 9.58, the greatest run of all. Daegu 2011: disqualified for a false start, his greatest disappointment. Beijing 2015: the defeat from nowhere of Gatlin, arguably his greatest miracle.\nThis was supposed to be the great finale. That the story was hijacked by a darker subplot will leave some feeling as if something sacred has been blemished, that same sense of sadness experienced by those who saw boxer Muhammad Ali beaten in 10 melancholic rounds by Trevor Berbick in his own concluding fight.\nYet sometimes perfection itself can become hard to understand when it seems to come so easy. In defeat, we can look back at all the glories of the past nine years and see that none were preordained and all claimed through an unprecedented blend of latent talent and unremitting hard work.\nBolt has done so much on the track that no other human has ever managed. That his last individual race revealed him to have a few mortal flaws after all should not undermine his status.\nHe talked of wanting to be remembered like Ali, like Pele. He will be.\nGatlin has his world title - but never will he win the same affection nor respect.

The leadership of most of these groups is based in Pakistan, and they have been largely dormant since the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto boundary dividing Kashmir.\nSo the claim by the UJC to have carried out this latest attack is likely to strengthen the view that it was authorised by the Pakistani army to undermine Mr Modi's recent peace overtures to Pakistan's civilian government.

{"document": "Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year.\nThat would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said.\nLabour said new homes were urgently needed but \"driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer.\nIn its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart.\nNeil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be \"less of it\".\n\"The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town.\n\"People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" he said.\nHe also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented.\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is something that councils can choose to do already.\n\"Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years.\n\"They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently.\n\"If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.\"\nBut Labour said the coalition's \"failed\" polices were \"making the housing crisis worse not better\".\nShadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: \"Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\"\nHe said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and \"put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry.\n'Lucky family'\nExpensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says.\nThis equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold.\nIt says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing.\nAbout 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said.\nThis meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said.\nMr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to.\n\"Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads.\n\"That seems fairer to me,\" he added.\nThe think tank also said the move would be \"extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority.\n'Dramatic erosion'\nCritics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos.\nThe National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be \"cleansed\" of \"hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices\".\nLabour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor.\nMs Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power.\nHousing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced \"radical reforms\" to \"get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists.\nThey included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme \"set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes\".\nCouncils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure \"social housing goes to those in greatest need\", he added.", "summary": "Councils should consider selling off their most expensive houses to build more cheap homes, the government says.", "id": "19311364"}
